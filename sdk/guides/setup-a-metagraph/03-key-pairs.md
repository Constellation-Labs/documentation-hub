Key pairs are a crucial part of securing your instances. They consist of a public key that AWS stores and a private key file that you store. The private key file is used to SSH into your instances securely. Follow the steps below to create a key pair:

- Navigate to the **`Key pairs`** page on the Amazon EC2 console.
    [Link to Key Pairs](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-west-2#KeyPairs)

:::note
You need to switch from us-west-2 to the region that youâ€™re using.

- Click on **`Create key pair`**.
- Provide a unique name for your key pair, such as: `MetagraphKeyPair`

Your screen should now look similar to this:

- After you click **`Create key pair`**, a new key pair will be generated, and your browser will automatically download a file that contains your private key.

:::important
Safeguard this file as it will be necessary for SSH access to your instances. Do not share this file or expose it publicly as it could compromise the security of your instances.

You've now created and secured your key pair for your instances.
