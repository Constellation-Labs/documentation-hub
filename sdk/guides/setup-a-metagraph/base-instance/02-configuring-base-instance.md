## Connecting to the instance

- From your **`Instances`** page, click on your instance.
- Then you should see something like this:

![configuring instance 01](/img/sdk/configuring-base-image-01.png)

- Click on the **`Connect`** button at the top of the page.
- We have different ways to access the instance. In this example, we will connect using `ssh`
- To use `ssh` we should use the file downloaded at step [Key pairs](/sdk/guides/setup-a-metagraph/key-pairs)
- Letâ€™s run the instance. We need to give privileges to the downloaded file

```jsx
chmod 400 MyKeypair.pem
```

- Now, use the **`ssh`** command to connect to your instance:

```jsx
ssh -i "MyKeypair.pem" ubuntu@your_instance.aws-region.compute.amazonaws.com
```

- The name/IP of the instance will be different, but you can get the instructions on how to connect via ssh in the **`Connect to your instance`** section of the EC2 Console.:

![configuring instance 012](/img/sdk/configuring-base-image-02.png)

- If asked to confirm the fingerprint of the instance, type **`yes`**.
- Once connected, you should see a screen similar to this:

![configuring instance 03](/img/sdk/configuring-base-image-03.png)

## Base instance setup

- Now, you can start setting up your instance. Create a directory named **`code`** and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir code
cd code/
```

- Additionally, let's create the following directories: `metagraph-l0`, `currency-l1`, and `data-l1`

```bash
mkdir global-l0
mkdir metagraph-l0
mkdir currency-l1
mkdir data-l1
```

- Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

```bash
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y
```

```bash
sudo apt-get install curl -y
sudo apt-get install wget -y
sudo apt-get install gnupg -y
```

```bash
sudo echo "deb https://repo.scala-sbt.org/scalasbt/debian all main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt.list
	sudo echo "deb https://repo.scala-sbt.org/scalasbt/debian /" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt_old.list
sudo curl -sL "https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x2EE0EA64E40A89B84B2DF73499E82A75642AC823" | sudo apt-key add
```

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

```bash
sudo apt-get install sbt -y
```

- For the metagraph execution you need to generate the metagraph JARs. There are two ways to obtain these JARs: 

  - [Generating JARs on Base Instance](/sdk/guides/setup-a-metagraph/base-instance/generating-metagraph-jars)
	-	[Generating JARs with the Euclid SDK](/sdk/guides/setup-a-metagraph/base-instance/using-jars-from-euclid)
  

## Setting up the genesis file

:::info
The Genesis file is a crucial component of your Metagraph. Thats where your metagraphID is generated and where you generate the initial token balances for your initial distributions.
:::

### Dependencies
- Start by downloading some files from the Tessellation repo releases. Go to the releases [https://github.com/Constellation-Labs/tessellation/releases/tag/v2.2.0](https://github.com/Constellation-Labs/tessellation/releases/tag/v2.2.0)
- Then we need the files: cl-keytool.jar, cl-wallet.jar, and cl-node.jar
- Move to the `code` directory and run the following
 
```bash
wget https://github.com/Constellation-Labs/tessellation/releases/download/v2.2.0/cl-node.jar
wget https://github.com/Constellation-Labs/tessellation/releases/download/v2.2.0/cl-wallet.jar
wget https://github.com/Constellation-Labs/tessellation/releases/download/v2.2.0/cl-keytool.jar

cp cl-wallet.jar metagraph-l0/cl-wallet.jar
cp cl-wallet.jar currency-l1/cl-wallet.jar
mv cl-wallet.jar data-l1/cl-wallet.jar

cp cl-keytool.jar metagraph-l0/cl-keytool.jar
cp cl-keytool.jar currency-l1/cl-keytool.jar
mv cl-keytool.jar data-l1/cl-keytool.jar

mv cl-node.jar global-l0/global-l0.jar
```

:::warning 
Make sure you're using the latest version of Tessellation. You can find the most recent release in [**here**](https://github.com/Constellation-Labs/tessellation/releases).
:::

### Creating Genesis file
- Move to the directory `code/metagraph-l0`
- Create a **`genesis.csv`** file:

```bash
touch genesis.csv
```

- Edit the genesis file:

:::info
The steps below use vim, you can use any text editor of your preference
:::

```bash
vim genesis.csv
```

- Add the following values to the file: 

```bash
DAG8pkb7EhCkT3yU87B2yPBunSCPnEdmX2Wv24sZ,1000000000000
DAG4o41NzhfX6DyYBTTXu6sJa6awm36abJpv89jB,1000000000000
DAG4Zd2W2JxL1f1gsHQCoaKrRonPSSHLgcqD7osU,1000000000000
```

:::info
Edit the addresses and balances according to your needs or leave the file empty if your Metagraph starts without any token distribution.
:::

### Generating metagraphID

-Now that you have generated your genesis file, the next step is to generate the metagraphID. To accomplish this, execute the following command:
```bash
export CL_KEYSTORE=test.p12
export CL_KEYALIAS=test
export CL_PASSWORD=test
export CL_PUBLIC_HTTP_PORT=9100
export CL_P2P_HTTP_PORT=9101
export CL_CLI_HTTP_PORT=9102
export CL_GLOBAL_L0_PEER_HTTP_HOST=localhost
export CL_GLOBAL_L0_PEER_HTTP_PORT=9000
export CL_GLOBAL_L0_PEER_ID=e2f4496e5872682d7a55aa06e507a58e96b5d48a5286bfdff7ed780fa464d9e789b2760ecd840f4cb3ee6e1c1d81b2ee844c88dbebf149b1084b7313eb680714
export CL_APP_ENV=integrationnet

java -jar cl-keytool.jar generate

nohup java -jar metagraph-l0.jar create-genesis genesis.csv > metagraph-l0.log 2>&1 &

rm test.p12
```
- The environment variables above are required, but they will be overwritten in the next steps
 
- This command should complete successfully, and you should find the following files in your directory:
  - `genesis.snapshot`
  - `genesis.address`

- You can open the `genesis.address` file to view your metagraphID, which should resemble a DAG address: `DAG...`

:::important
The MetagraphID needs to be shared with the Constellation Network team to be added to the Allowance List
:::

The base instance is now completely configured and you will use it in all Metagraph instances
