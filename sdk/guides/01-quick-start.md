This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a minimal development environment using the Euclid Development Environment project, installing the Currency Framework, and launching clusters. The process should take less than an hour, including installing dependencies. 

:::info Windows Support
Primary development focus for this SDK is based on UNIX-based operating systems like macOS or Linux. With that being said, Windows support is available using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to emulate a UNIX environment. The following guide has been tested in that environment and works wells. 

See [Install WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) for more detail in setting up WSL on your Windows machine.

## Install Dependencies

#### Install Basic Dependencies
Many developers can skip this step because these dependencies are already installed.

- [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)
- [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/)
- [Jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/)


#### Install argc
```bash
cargo install argc
```

#### Install Giter
```bash
./cs install giter8
```

#### Configure Docker
The Euclid Development Environment starts up to 10 individual docker containers to create a minimal development environment which takes some significant system resources. Configure docker to make at least 8GB of RAM available. If you are using Docker Desktop, this setting can be found under Preferences -> Resources. 

#### Create a Github Access Token
See instructions for how to create an [access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). The token only needs `read:packages` scope. Save this token for later, it will be added as an environment variable.


## Install

#### Clone
Clone the Euclid Development Environment project to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/Constellation-Labs/euclid-development-environment
cd euclid-development-environment
```

See the [Development Environment](/sdk/elements/dev-environment#project-directory-structure) section for an overview of the directory structure of the project. 

#### Configure
Edit the `github_token` variable within the `euclid.json` file with your Github Access Token generated previously. Update the `PROJECT_NAME` variable to the name of your project. 
```
GITHUB_TOKEN=<your token here>
PROJECT_NAME=<your-project-name>
```


#### Hydra
Familiarize yourself with the `hydra` CLI. We can use the `hydra` CLI tool to build the necessary docker containers and manage our network clusters. 

```
scripts/hydra -h

USAGE: hydra <COMMAND>

COMMANDS:
  install        Builds framework from template 
  build          Build the clusters
  start_genesis  Start built clusters from genesis block
  stop           Stop all the containers
  destroy        Destroy all the containers
  status         Check the status of the containers
```

#### Install Project
Running the `install` command will do two things:
- Creates currency-l0 and currency-l1 projects from a g8 template and moves them to the `source/project` directory. 
- Detach your project from the source repo. 

Detaching your project from the source repo removes its remote git configuration and prepares your project to be included in your own version control. Once detached, your project can be updated with `hydra`. 

```
scripts/hydra install   
```

## Build
Build your network clusters with hydra. By default, this builds `global-l0`, `metagraph-l0`, `metagraph-l1-currency`, `metagraph-l1-data`, and `prometheus` + `grafana` monitoring containers. The `dag-l1` cluster is not built by default since it isn't strictly necessary for metagraph development. You can include it on the `euclid.json` file. 

Start the build process. This can take a significant amount of time... be patient. 
```
scripts/hydra build
```

## Run
After your containers are built, go ahead and start them with the `start_genesis` command. This starts all network components from a fresh genesis snapshot. 
```
scripts/hydra start_genesis
```

Once the process is complete you should see output like this: 
```
Containers successfully built. 

URLs:
Global L0:  http://localhost:9000/cluster/info
Currency L0 - 1:  http://localhost:9400/cluster/info
Currency L0 - 2:  http://localhost:9500/cluster/info
Currency L0 - 3:  http://localhost:9600/cluster/info
Currency L1 - 1:  http://localhost:9700/cluster/info
Currency L1 - 2:  http://localhost:9800/cluster/info
Currency L1 - 3:  http://localhost:9900/cluster/info
Data L1 - 1:  http://localhost:8000/cluster/info
Data L1 - 2:  http://localhost:8100/cluster/info
Data L1 - 3:  http://localhost:8200/cluster/info
Grafana:  http://localhost:3000/
```

You can also check the status of your containers with the `status` command. 
```
scripts/hydra status
```
