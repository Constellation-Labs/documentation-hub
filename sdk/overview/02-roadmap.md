By providing this roadmap, our goal is to provide you with a clear and concise overview of the milestones we have achieved so far and outline our immediate plans for upcoming releases. By sharing this information, we aim to maintain transparency within our developer community and encourage engagement with our network.

As the world of metagraph development continues to evolve, we understand that circumstances may change, and new priorities may emerge. Consequently, our roadmap focuses primarily on the immediate future, detailing the features and improvements planned for the near term. While we have a vision for the long term, we acknowledge that it may not be feasible to predict every aspect of our development journey far into the future.

Please note that the information provided on this page is subject to change, as we continually refine our plans and adapt to the ever-changing landscape of metagraph development. We encourage you to revisit this page regularly to stay informed about our progress and learn about any updates to our roadmap.
