## Using the Faucet
Constellation hosts a testnet faucet to get test DAG for testing purposes. This coin has no value and can only be used on the testnet. The faucet provides small amounts of DAG at each request with rate limiting to prevent depletion of its DAG reserves. 

The faucet can be accessed at:
