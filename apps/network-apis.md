Interaction with Constellation Network version 2.0 is possible using three independent REST APIs which can be called for specific functionality. The three APIs share a common request and response format. 

- **L0 API**: An on-node API for getting real time information on snapshots, and address balances as well as for submitting L1 snapshots. 
- **L1 API**: An on-node API for posting DAG transactions and getting information on address parent references. 
- **Block Explorer API**: An off-network API offering indexed and searchable transactions, snapshots, and block information.
