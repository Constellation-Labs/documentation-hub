## What is the Hypergraph Network? 
The Hypergraph is a distributed ledger technology known as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) protocol with a novel reputation-based consensus model called Proof of Reputable Observation (PRO). Hypergraph is a feeless decentralized network that supports the transfer of $DAG cryptocurrency and data validation for state channels. 

## What is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)? 
A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a data model that consists of vertices and edges. It is a more efficient alternative to a tranditional blockchain. A blockchain can be thought of as a chain of transactions, one after another. A DAG is a tree-like structure that can be thought of more like a graph. 

## What is HGTP? 
HGTP is a feeless decentralized network that supports the transfer of $DAG cryptocurrency. Itâ€™s secure, infinitely scalable, and cross-chain interoperable. The core elements include DAG-based architecture, PRO (Proof of Reputable Observation) consensus model, distributed node operators for validation, and a collection of State Channels for application support.

## What is $DAG? 
$DAG is the native cryptocurrency of the Hypergraph that operates as a special case state channel. It allows for seamless exchange and interaction between the various state channels and nodes that make up the Network. $DAG binds the network components together so that they relate to one another.

## What is the Global L0 Network?
The Global L0 Network, or HyperGraph, is the base layer of the network that performs final validation of data through a network of validator nodes before submitting data to the global immutable ledger. The L0 network sits below traditional L1 networks like Ethereum, Solana, or Bitcoin because it can validate any format of data including data from L1 networks via state channels. See [Network Architecture](/core-concepts/network/architecture) for more information. 

## What is a state channel? 
A state channel is an independent network or microservice that connects with the global L0 network. State channels are capable of processing and validating complex data types based on custom business logic. They form the second layer of the network after the global L0. See [State Channels](/core-concepts/network/state-channels) and [Network Architecture](/core-concepts/network/architecture) for more information.

## Are there any fees on the network? 
Yes, there are but the majority of transactions are completely feeless. Each wallet is limited to one free transaction per snapshot (roughly every 5 seconds). For the vast majority of users, this will mean that there is no need to ever pay fees on the network. For uses that require transactions to be sent at a more rapid rate a fee of 1 datum (0.00000001 DAG) will give priority on the network and allow transactions to be processed as fast as the L1 network can package them into blocks (hundreds per snapshot).
