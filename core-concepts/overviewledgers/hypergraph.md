Think of a Hypergraph as a graph that allows you to model group relations instead of only binary relations, enabling a graph to be constructed 
of other graphs. It enables different graphs to be connected together by their relationships to form a greater graph structure. In this Hypergraph
structure there is the notion of “Hyper-edges” and “Hyper-vertices” that connect the graphs together, with each hyperedge connecting an arbitrary number
of hypervertices (instead of only two in a regular graph). This allows Constellation Network to weave immutable state data together originating from
entirely different networks and systems, into one ever-evolving data structure. The Hypergraph can be used to compose complex decentralized application
logic, such as multi-network API calls and cross-network exchange of tokenized assets.
