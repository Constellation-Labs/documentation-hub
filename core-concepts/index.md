Constellation’s Network, Hypergraph, and transportation protocol HGTP provide speed, security, and L_0 consensus with no base layer fees. Through the creation of state channels with advanced programmable business logic and a feeless peer-to-peer network, we provide a myriad of opportunities for anyone to develop a business that attracts value from the Constellation ecosystem — with economic incentives. Our aim is to attract the next blockchain entrepreneur to build a scalable business with confidence from multiple stakeholders that engage with the business.

This section of the documentation hub will give you an overview of the architecture of the network and the relevant concepts to building on the Hypergraph network.
