This section provides in-depth, step-by-step instructions for manual setup and custom development processes that cater to specific use cases. While we offer a separate section for the [Euclid SDK](/sdk), complete with quick start guides for a streamlined setup experience, we recommend exploring the resources in this section to developers who want a deeper understanding of the underlying components. For most developers, starting with the SDK is recommended. 

The guides contained in this section cover various topics essential for metagraph developers, such as compiling Tessellation from source, setting up L0 and L1 clusters, and a Data Transfer Demo, which serves as a custom development example provided by [Alkimi Exchange](https://www.alkimi.org/). By following these guides, you'll gain valuable insights into the inner workings of metagraph development and acquire greater understanding of working with [Tessellation](/metagraphs/components/tessellation).
