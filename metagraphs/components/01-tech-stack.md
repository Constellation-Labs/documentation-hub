The Hypergraph uses Scala as its primary programming language to leverage the benefits of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and its associated tooling. This decision aligns with the network's core principles of providing a scalable, secure, and versatile platform for developers to build on.

## The JVM

Utilizing the JVM grants metagraph developers access to a mature ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and development tools. This enables developers to rapidly build and deploy applications, reducing both time-to-market and overall development costs. Additionally, the JVM's proven track record of performance, stability, and security ensures that the Constellation Network remains a reliable platform for enterprise-grade applications.

Building Hypergraph tooling on top of the JVM offers inherent interoperability with other JVM languages such as Java, Kotlin, and Clojure. This allows developers to leverage existing skills and resources, minimizing the learning curve while maximizing productivity. The combination of a mature tooling ecosystem, a versatile programming language, and seamless interoperability with other JVM languages makes the Constellation Network an attractive choice for developers seeking to create scalable, secure, and efficient DLTs with micro-service architectures.

## Scala
Constellation’s core framework is developed with Scala v2.x and is forward compatible with Scala 3.x.

Scala, a versatile and expressive language, combines the best of both functional and object-oriented programming paradigms. This makes it an ideal choice for metagraph development, as it fosters clean and maintainable code while promoting modular design principles. By embracing Scala, the Constellation Network empowers developers with a sophisticated and powerful language that facilitates building complex applications with ease.

## How it’s used

Scala is frequently employed in mission-critical applications, including large-scale fintech, government, and artificial intelligence projects that demand the highest levels of information assurance and code integrity. It has been extensively tested and proven effective in the backends of numerous large, complex distributed systems used daily. In such systems, applications are deployed as collections of microservices on auto-scaling groups, benefiting from the easy provisioning provided by the JVM. In these scenarios, cloud-hosted virtual instances can provision and auto-scale thousand-node clusters. Constellation's microservices architecture offers the potential for the same level of extensive scalability.
