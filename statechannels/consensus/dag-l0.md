Each state channel is meant to serve a specific use case and the DAG L0 is no different. The purpose of the DAG L0 is to provide a meta consensus process that allows L1 ledgers to swap values. In order to maximize security scalability and decentralization for this use case, its ACI contains definitions for performing hash based validation on ledger state as each state channel's executible and contains fields necessary to define a state channel's "liquidity pool" which is a configuration for handling transactions and normalization across L1 ledgers.
