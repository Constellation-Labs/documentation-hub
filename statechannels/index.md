A state channel is a living economy that operates on top of the Hypergraph Network. You can also think of a state channel as a microservice or a *smarter* smart contract. A state channel operates as an autonomous network (an L0 subnet with its own business logic, technical infrastructure, and consensus model) that converges with Hypergraph's Global L0. Together, state channels form a distributed network that can accommodate big data in many real world contexts.

The Hypergraph network is based on a generative economic system where all participants in the network benefit from the success of each individual node and state channel—the sum is greater than its parts in terms of security, throughput and the economic growth of the network.

## A *Smarter* Smart Contract

State channels are *smarter* smart contracts with more robust security, permissions, and control over the data.

### State Channels vs Smart Contracts

| State Channels | Smart Contracts |
| --- | --- |
| Free to define their own business logic, rewards, and metrics | Bound into an economic relationship with their blockchain (e.g. Ethereum) |
| Can execute smart contracts or trade ERC-20 tokens for another without any gas fees (LTX, powered by Constellation) | They incur in gas fees, such as when trading an ERC-20 token for another |
| They define their own custom parameters and can execute complex logic, far beyond “if/then” | They simply automate “if/then” logic based on pre-set conditions |
| They solve the oracle problem by validating data itself, from the origin of where it comes self | They require an oracle to validate information from the real world |
| Able to process arbitrary data from multiple blockchains or any data sources | Limited to specific blockchains from which they emanate |
| They allow multiple data types simultaneously because of HGTP’s horizontal data architecture | Slow and bottlenecked because of their built-in limitation on Ethereum |
| Allows you to pay node operators in your own L0 minted token, DAG or any token | Makes you pay expensive network fees in ETH for interfacing with Ethereum |
| They get faster and cheaper the more data is going through it | They become more expensive and slower the more traffic occurs at the same time |

## Interoperability

- Ability to accept, process and validate third party data from real world data sources. For example, state channels can accept data from sources such as cars, consumer electronics devices, temperature sensors, advertising exchanges, financial exchanges, etc. and act upon triggers from these sources.
- Developers are able to integrate state channels directly into existing applications whether legacy or current, allowing for direct E2E security and frictionless deployment. Interoperability creates a seamless bridge for centralized systems to transition or incorporate elements of decentralization within their business model.
- Ability to accept, process and validate data from other blockchains. For example, state channels can accept data from other blockchains such as Ethereum.

## Infinite Scalability and Speed

- Hypergraph enables infinite horizontal scalability of the network, which enables state channels to use the bandwidth to run complex operations of huge sets of data in order to implement business logic. This also enables state channels to provide very fast and cost-efficient transactions ensuring that users do not have to wait for long periods of time or pay high gas fees, in order to complete their transactions.

## Custom Consensus Mechanisms

- One of the most powerful features that Hypergraph provides state channels is the ability to define custom consensus mechanisms. This enables them to validate real world data and implement complex logic in order to arrive at decisions. This is impossible on any other blockchain solution currently available on the market.
- Hypergraph also allows the concept of Lite Nodes, which enables state channel logic to run on edge devices, such as, cars, mobile phones, consumer devices, smart watches, etc. which can validate data at the source before it can be processed further.

## L0 Token Standard

- A state channel can mint their own L0 token on the network which can be used to assign value to data and create their own tokenomics which can be used to transact within the specific ecosystem, define specific business logic and reward node operators and users.
- The **L0 Token Standard** allows for cross-chain liquid base tokens (like ERC-20).
- Liquidity. The key to a liquid digital economy are cryptocurrencies that are seamlessly liquid with one another, transacting in a feeless network.

## The Oracle Problem

A data oracle is a bridge between the blockchain and the real world. They provide on-chain
APIs that send real world data to and from a smart contract. These oracles depend on off-chain data sources which feed in the data to the blockchain. These data sources are centralized components and are susceptible to problems with the integrity, validity and security of associated data. They are also susceptible to attacks by hackers who can change the behavior of the smart contract by controlling the data that drives these contracts. Centralizing the data source that drives the smart contracts also undermines the decentralized nature of the blockchain. This is referred to as the the Oracle Problem.

The Hypergraph network makes it possible for any state channel to interoperate and exchange data with each other while orchestrating complex validation logic through each step of the consensus process, from its point of origin to its destination. This solves the Oracle Problem and enables the state of external "off-chain" data to be validated at its source and then incorporated "on-chain".
