Constellation’s core framework is developed with Scala v2.x and should be forwards compatible with Scala 3.x.

## What is Scala?

Scala is a type-safe JVM language that incorporates both object-oriented and functional programming into an extremely concise and high-level language. Scala's static types help avoid bugs in complex applications, and its JVM and JavaScript runtimes let you build high-performance systems with easy access to huge ecosystems of libraries.

A while back, Google conducted a [study](https://days2011.scala-lang.org/sites/days2011/files/ws3-1-Hundt.pdf) where they compared C++, Java, Scala, and Go. They concluded that Scala was faster than both Java and Go when average developers wrote code without optimization in mind. In another study, Scala was reported to be 20% [faster](https://jto.github.io/articles/scala_is_faster_than_java/) than Java.

## How it’s used

It is commonly used for mission critical applications such as large-scale Fintech, Government, and Artificial Intelligence that require extreme level of information assurance and code integrity. Scala has been battle tested and used for the backends of many of the largest and most complex distributed systems we use every day, where applications are deployed as a collection of microservices on auto-scaling groups which rely on easy provisioning, which the JVM provides. In these scenarios, a thousand node clusters can be provisioned and auto-scaled on cloud hosted virtual instances. The same infinite scalability can be realized with Constellation's microservices architecture.
