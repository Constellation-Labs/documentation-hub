In a decentralized platform, the nodes are not controlled by any single entity;
thus we cannot necessarily impose a pre-defined trust on them to prevent malicious behavior on the network. This raises a more fundamental question:
why is the trust of a node relevant to the network? It is well-known from distributed computing that separate parts of the network often have different sets
of data due to concurrency and latency. The network needs to eventually reach a consensus about the state of the network â€” thereby
formalizing the true state of transactions and data flowing in the network. However, in an open permissionless network, a node may propagate falsified
data and try to establish a wrong state of the network aligned with their incentive (financial or otherwise). In that case, deciding between two
sets of conflicting data is not easy without taking into account the reputation of the nodes behind them.

Despite the various rewards mechanisms devised to incent the decentralized ownership of nodes, cryptocurrencies are operated and secured by increasingly centralized networks and mining organizations
that control the security of the network. Bitcoin was created to solve the problem of distributed consensus for financial transactions, but
relied upon the energy intensive consensus process known as proof of work. This pools vertical computational power from a select few individuals
with well-developed and hence centralized computing power. With proof-of-stake, there is a democratic imbalance where the economic
incentives to join the network is biased towards nodes with the most financial stake. These factors have inevitably paved the way for further
centralization of power within these networks, verticalizing mining operations and centralizing large bondholders as a plutocracy, or, a monopoly
in the case of delegated proof-of-stake incentive structures.
