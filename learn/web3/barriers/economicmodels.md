The challenges outlined thus far generate financial barriers for individuals to utilize these protocols and
prevents enterprises from building profitable and sustainable business models on top of them. The cost of doing business must make economic sense
for all participants in the network otherwise the value exchange is fundamentally undermined from the start. The current fee-per-transaction model
quickly become cost prohibitive and non-viable for businesses dependent on the protocol to process their data. Existing decentralized protocols
break down when the utilization of the network is correlated with rising and variable transaction fees, ultimately discouraging its use.
These variable costs make it unpredictable to conduct business and scale operations. Therefore, infrastructure layers utilizing transaction
fees as their overarching economic sink are only justifiable for use cases with limited economic scope and technical scalability.
