One of the primary challenges with existing Blockchain/DLT networks is that they are closed systems which cannot directly interface with stateful
systems that are external to them, making it difficult, or in many cases impossible to integrate into existing technological
infrastructure and business processes. This inflexibility also creates a barrier to comply with existing regulations and standards.
To date, the industry has proposed a fragmented set of "bridging" solutions in an attempt to enable interoperability between different
ledgers and "off-chain" systems, however, none have entirely solved the problem. The challenge which prevents effective
interoperability solutions from emerging can be understood as "The Oracle Problem", which is the inability to securely incorporate
data derived from external systems into the consensus process of a blockchain. The narrow data types that current blockchains
and distributed ledgers are capable of storing and validating creates a need for a mechanism to validate and relay information
through separate middle-ware protocols, referred to as Oracles. The reliance on separate Oracle networks to bridge external data introduces
external dependencies which can complicate development, limit composability of complex logic, and inhibit the ability for a decentralized
application to scale and diversify its business logic.
