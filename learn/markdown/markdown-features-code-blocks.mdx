# Code blocks

import BrowserWindow from '@site/src/components/global/BrowserWindow';
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

Code blocks within documentation are super-powered ðŸ’ª.

## Code title {#code-title}

You can add a title to the code block by adding a `title` key after the language (leave a space between them).

````md
```jsx title="/src/components/HelloCodeTitle.js"
function HelloCodeTitle(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```
````

```mdx-code-block
<BrowserWindow>
```

```jsx title="/src/components/HelloCodeTitle.js"
function HelloCodeTitle(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

```mdx-code-block
</BrowserWindow>
```

## Syntax highlighting {#syntax-highlighting}

Code blocks are text blocks wrapped around by strings of 3 backticks. You may check out [this reference](https://github.com/mdx-js/specification) for the specifications of MDX.

````md
```js
console.log('Every repo must come with a mascot.');
```
````

Use the matching language meta string for your code block, and Docusaurus will pick up syntax highlighting automatically, powered by [Prism React Renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer).

<BrowserWindow>

```js
console.log('Every repo must come with a mascot.');
```

</BrowserWindow>

### Supported Languages {#supported-languages}

By default, Docusaurus comes with a subset of [commonly used languages](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer/blob/master/src/vendor/prism/includeLangs.js).

:::caution

Some popular languages like Java, C#, or PHP are not enabled by default.

:::

To add syntax highlighting for any of the other [Prism-supported languages](https://prismjs.com/#supported-languages), define it in an array of additional languages.

:::note

Each additional language has to be a valid Prism component name. For example, Prism would map the _language_ `cs` to `csharp`, but only `prism-csharp.js` exists as a _component_, so you need to use `additionalLanguages: ['csharp']`. You can look into `node_modules/prismjs/components` to find all components (languages) available.

:::

For example, if you want to add highlighting for the PowerShell language:

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
module.exports = {
  // ...
  themeConfig: {
    prism: {
      // highlight-next-line
      additionalLanguages: ['powershell'],
    },
    // ...
  },
};
```

After adding `additionalLanguages`, restart Docusaurus.

If you want to add highlighting for languages not yet supported by Prism, you can swizzle `prism-include-languages`:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run swizzle @docusaurus/theme-classic prism-include-languages
```

It will produce `prism-include-languages.js` in your `src/theme` folder. You can add highlighting support for custom languages by editing `prism-include-languages.js`:

```js title="src/theme/prism-include-languages.js"
const prismIncludeLanguages = (Prism) => {
  // ...

  additionalLanguages.forEach((lang) => {
    require(`prismjs/components/prism-${lang}`);
  });

  // highlight-next-line
  require('/path/to/your/prism-language-definition');

  // ...
};
```

You can refer to [Prism's official language definitions](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/tree/master/components) when you are writing your own language definitions.
