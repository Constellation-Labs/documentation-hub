The Hypergraph's native cryptocurrency is known as $DAG. The $DAG operates on an exclusive metagraph that facilitates seamless interaction between metagraphs and network nodes. In other words, $DAG binds network components together and is how the Hypergraph provides utility.

## DAG L1 Network​
DAG Layer 1 (L1) is a special case metagraph that validates DAG currency transactions for the network and bundles them into blocks which are then submitted to the global L0 network for final validation. This metagraph enables $DAG which is the native currency of the network

The DAG L1 network is a special case metagraph that validates transactions, runs them through parallel rounds of consensus, and processes them into blocks that are then submitted to the Global L0 network for inclusion in a Global Snapshot. DAG is the native currency of the network.

### What is $DAG ?

Constellation’s [$DAG coin](https://constellationnetwork.io/dag-token) is a cryptocurrency platform built on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure. This hypergraph-based protocol enables Constellation to create a trustless, decentralized network of nodes that share data in real time — without the need for mining or other energy-intensive processes.

DAG operates on a special-case Layer 1 network that interacts directly with the Global L0, binding all components of the Hypergraph for  scalability and feeless peer-to-peer transactions. $DAG's microservice framework allows for advanced data connections to be made in a secure manner.

## Technology Behind the Coin

At its core, Constellation’s Directed Acyclic Graph Structure (DAG) structure uses nodes to store data and validate transactions. This structure allows for significantly faster processing times than traditional proof-of-work models, as well as improved security due to its distributed architecture — meaning that no single node can control or manipulate the data stored on the chain. DAG-based networks are built to be more flexible and scalable than traditional blockchain networks, meaning they can handle larger amounts of data in shorter times. This is especially useful for applications such as digital identity management, asset tracking, supply chain management, and so on. Furthermore, while many other coins suffer from a lack of scalability due to their consensus mechanisms, Constellation has addressed this issue head on by building its network with a focus on scalability.

## Who Uses $DAG?

Constellation's $DAG coin offers several benefits that can improve crypto transactions' efficiency and security. The architecture of the system is ideal for:

### Token Purchasers and Holders

Individuals that have purchased $DA are sending it between their wallets, using it as a peer-to-peer currency.

### Node Validators

These individuals manage nodes and receive $DAG as a reward for participating in Hypergraph and consensus. Consensus is the programmatic means to govern and optimize the network with speed and security. The collection of these nodes is distributed, and forms the Hypergraph.

### Metagraph Businesses

With Constellation's HGTP protocol, individuals and organizations can create immutable, automated and programmatic businesses and tokens with the Metagraph Token Standard.

## The Tokenization of Data

A [$DAG token](https://medium.com/constellationlabs/dag-defined-52cb5c8fc441) represents network bandwidth, enabling transactions over the rate limit as well as the monetization of data streams. $DAG users become "datapreneurs" and can buy and sell data as they see fit.

Within Constellation's network, the $DAG token plays a few other roles:

- Nodes earn validator rewards in the form of $DAG.
- $DAG is used to secure throughput on the network.
- $DAG will be used to purchase validated data sets on the network.

The tokenization of data could one day allow data packages to be traded and sold like commodities.

## The mission of $DAG

By leveraging a unique combination of nodes and rewards, $DAG wallet users can unlock the power of the decentralized network and reap the benefits of this cutting-edge technology. The more metagraphs that launch on the network, the more utility the $DAG token will have, and the more scarce $DAG will become. By holding $DAG, you can participate in the [generative economics of the network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGfMsrskf3A) and support increased bandwidth in various ways.
