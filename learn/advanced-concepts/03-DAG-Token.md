##

DAG is the Hypergraph's native cryptocurrency. The [$DAG token](https://constellationnetwork.io/dag-token) operates on an exclusive metagraph that facilitates seamless interaction between metagraphs and network nodes. In other words, $DAG binds network components together and is how the Hypergraph provides utility.

The mission of the DAG token, is to promote Constellation's Network by incentivizing participation from all stakeholders, from Validator Nodes to metagraphs.

DAG tokens are distributed as rewards to those responsible for securing and maintaining the decentralized network, thereby ensuring a decentralized ecosystem. A fundamental principle from DAG's mission is the facilitation of low-complexity transactions without transaction fees, a move designed to promote network adoption and lower entry barriers for users. 

The DAG token is also instrumental in fostering a scalable economic model that can accommodate the projected growth of the network.

## Who Uses $DAG?
The DAG token plays an important role in incentivizing key players in Constellation's Network: 

### Node Validators
Which provide computational resources to validate and confirm transactions, are rewarded with DAG tokens for their contributions to network security and uptime.

### Metagraphs
Which play a role in the validation process and pay fees to the Hypergraph for each state snapshot submitted. These fees are submitted in DAG tokens, and the fee structure provides a measure of deflationary pressure on the ecosystem.

### Network users

Individuals that have purchased $DAG using it as a peer-to-peer currency.

## DAG L1 Networkâ€‹
DAG Layer 1 (L1) is a special case metagraph that validates DAG currency transactions for the network and bundles them into blocks which are then submitted to the global L0 network for final validation. This metagraph enables $DAG which is the native currency of the network

The DAG L1 network is a special case metagraph that validates transactions, runs them through parallel rounds of consensus, and processes them into blocks that are then submitted to the Global L0 network for inclusion in a Global Snapshot. DAG is the native currency of the network.
