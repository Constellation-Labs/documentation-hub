Over the past decade, Blockchain technology has captured the attention of governments,
enterprises, and individuals alike for its potential to introduce a new dimension of trust
into the digital infrastructure that underpins society's value chains. The unprecedented
level of cryptographic security and information assurance that Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT)
can provide is relevant to solving many of the fundamental problems encountered with the existing
internet. Decentralized consensus and validation of digital information can facilitate a paradigm
shift in the way we interact, navigate, and relate through modern society. It presents a path
towards enabling trust-less interactions between individuals, businesses, organizations, 
governments, and machines, which will allow for aggregate efficiencies to form within the systems and
networks that interconnect us. Constellation Network's goal is to accelerate the realization of this Web 3.0 vision by equipping 
developers with a scalable, secure, and interoperable decentralized protocol framework referred
to as the **Hypergraph Transfer Protocol (HGTP)**. 

Businesses and individuals are in desperate need of a reliable mechanism to exchange and monetize the data
that they generate in a privacy preserving manner while constructing an immutable provenance of ownership. 
Web 3.0 enables entirely new business models to be feasible while ensuring that 
data producers are at the center of the value exchange and not exploited by businesses 
and organizations who centrally store, analyze, and sell their information. The current model
jeopardizes both the sovereignty and security of private data and does not return value to 
the data producer, rather it extracts it using intentionally obtuse and verbose legalese
as a consent mechanism which prevents meaningful recourse by design.
The automation of secure and verifiable Peer to Peer (P2P) interactions
including legal contracts, micro-loans and payments, voting, tokenized
representation of ownership, and so on, will enable the transformation of illiquid assets into liquid assets.
Unlocking the value of latent data will create new opportunities while enabling physical assets to be exchanged and owned in new ways.

This creates space for new governance models of dynamic representation and delegation to form which could intelligently align short, mid,
and long term interests through data driven identification of incentive structures, ultimately
harmonizing societies, economies, and the environment. Constellation Network's permission-less, opensource, DLT toolkit can serve as the foundation for coordinating
society at the scale and efficiency required to enable unprecedented levels of transparency, security, privacy, 
and fidelity that has previously not been possible with existing Blockchain/DLT technology stacks.

In short, Constellation Network's mission is to enable **Honest Data for a Connected Future**
