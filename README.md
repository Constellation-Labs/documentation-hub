# Constellation Docs

The official [Constellation](https://constellationnetwork.io) documentation, built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

---

## Development Workflow

In order to run the documentation locally, install the dependencies and run the development server:

```sh
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

> **Note**: As some docusaurus modules run only on node versions +14 or +16 this project will use node ^16.14.2 by default.
