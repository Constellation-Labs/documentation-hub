Constellation provides developers with a full featured integration net to test applications and metagraphs before they're ready for the production environment. 
The integration net has all of the same features as mainnet and can therefore be used to validate application integrations in a realistic way. 

:::info Developing a Metagraph
Metagraph developers may use integration net as they're nearing production readiness. See [Setup a metagraph](/sdk/guides/setup-a-metagraph/overview).
