**Constellation Network** is proud and excited to see you here and help you during your journey towards running
a validator node on either a state channel or the Global Layer 0.

## Before you begin:

:::info Are you on the seedlist?
Both **Mainnet 2.0** and **Testnet 2.0** currently have a seedlist in place that only allows specific `NodeIds` to join the network.
This provides an extra layer of security and stability as the ecosystem matures, and will eventually be phased out for anyone to join. If you'd like to get your name on the list, please fill out [this form](https://cypress-metal-1d9.notion.site/Node-Validators-80876addcf914fcbb014d80ff738ded4) and we will process requests as network resources allow.
