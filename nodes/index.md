**Constellation Network** is proud and excited to see you here and help you during your journey towards running
a **Validator Node** on either a `State Channel` or the `Global Layer 0`.

We appreciate your commitment and hope that the following documentation will ease your entry into the ecosystem. 

:::info Seed List in place
  Both Constellation MainNet and TestNet currently have a **`seed list`** in place that limits which validator nodes are able to join the network. This system provides an extra layer of security and stability as the ecosystem matures and will eventually be removed. In the meantime, you can join the [waitlist](/) [TODO INSERT LINK] to be added to the list as slots become available.
