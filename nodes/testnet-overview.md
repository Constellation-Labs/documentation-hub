## Welcome to TestNet 2.0

Constellation Network is proud to introduce to you TestNet 2.0.  

Please refer to the **Validator Node** section of this documentation to learn how to build, deploy and operate your
Validator Node on the Constellation Network *HyperGraph*.  Utilizing your Validator Node you will learn how to 
join your Node to either a **Layer 0 State Channel** on the **TestNet 2.0** HyperGraph.

While on the **TestNet** you will be able to:

- Safely and securely manipulate and test your Validator Node's 
functionality.
- Help other State Channel companies build, test and prepare to deploy their State Channels.
- Help Constellation Network's **core** protocol team enhance **MainNet 2.0**.
