## What is nodectl?

In order to remove the complexity around building out a **Constellation Network Tessellation Validator Node**, Constellation Network and Node Garage have teamed up to create a command line utility to do all the "heavy lifting" for you.

#### Installation

Prior to the release of the latest version of `nodectl`, we will update this document shortly.
