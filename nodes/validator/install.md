## Before you begin:

:::danger Are you on the seedlist?
Both Mainnet 2.0 and Testnet 2.0 currently have a seedlist in place that only allows specific `NodeIds` to join the network. This provides an extra layer of security and stability as the ecosystem matures, and will eventually be phased out for anyone to join. The seedlist is currently closed although we are accepting applications from state channel developers or integration partners that need access to develop on the network. Please fill out [this form](https://airtable.com/shroR5bXszQXdh6dn) if you fit into that category.
