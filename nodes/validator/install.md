## Before you begin:

:::danger Are you on the seedlist?
Both **Mainnet 2.0** and **Testnet 2.0** currently have a seedlist in place that only allows specific `NodeIds` to join the network.
This provides an extra layer of security and stability as the ecosystem matures, and will eventually be phased out for anyone to join. If you'd like to get your name on the list, please fill out [this form](https://cypress-metal-1d9.notion.site/Node-Validators-80876addcf914fcbb014d80ff738ded4) and we will process requests as network resources allow.
