#### EIP Control Panel

Instance (future Node) will need to be `stopped` and `started`.  With the current configuration, **AWS** will `disassociate` or `external IP` automatically, and assign us a new one, on restart.  We do **not** want our IP Address to change. 

To fix this, we will setup an `Elastic IP address` to **persist** our Internet presence.

##### Open up the eIP control panel.

Select the **`Allocate EIP Address`** button.

Make sure we have selected the `same region` as our instance was created in. Click on **`allocate`**.

AWS will now assign (allocate) an **eIP** for us to use.  Let's `verify` that our **eIP** is assigned to us.

**Select** the `eIP`.

:::danger IMPORTANT 
You will **not** be charged for an `eIP` that is in use; **however**, you **will** be charged for an allocated eIP that is **not in use**.
:::

From the top RIGHT choose the **`Actions`** dropdown, and select **`Associate Elastic IP address`** . In the ðŸ‘† above section we selected the eIP.

We want to associate to our instance.


 - Choose **`Instance`**
 - Select (Search for) our created **`Instance`**
 - Our **`Private IP Address`** will auto populate (no need to change anything here)
 - Finally we can click the **`associate`** button.
