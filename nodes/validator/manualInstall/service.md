### Create or Transfer a P12 private key file

##### We are now ready to create our Tessellation service!

The below ðŸ‘‡ definitions table shows the assumptions that are made in order to follow along with the `step-by-step` documentation in this repository.  If you had decided to **change** anything during the course of your build, you will need to substitute those changes as necessary. 

| Variable |	Value |
| -------- | ------ |
| Cloud instance hostname |	**node-garage**. Your instance will **not** have the same hostname. Substitute `node-garage` with whatever your instance has been called during setup |
| User we will work with or add |	**nodeadmin** |
| [...] | When you see this in our examples, it will mean that there may be extra output from a command issued. The output is not important for our purposes, so it is redacted. The symbol will be shown above the code that is important or below the code that is important. |

#### INSTRUCTIONS

From your **local system**, log into your **cloud instance's** terminal as **nodeadmin** using your Apple terminal, Window's PuTTY, or your terminal application of choice.

:::note
You can remind yourself how to access your VPS here for [Macintosh](../accessMac) or [Windows](../accessWin).
:::

Bring our Node up to date

```
sudo apt -y update && sudo apt -y upgrade
```

You will be prompted for your nodeadmin password.
:::warning
Your screen will not react and your password will not show as you type.  
**Reminder**: `[...]` in the output command examples means that there is a bunch of output that has been redacted to eliminate confusion. 
:::
```
[sudo] password for nodeadmin:
[...]
```

We are going to modify our **`cn-node`** Bash script file first. 

Once again we will using **Nano** editor.

:::info NANO INSTRUCTIONS
How to use the `nano` text editor is out of scope of this document; however, you can read up on how to create, edit and save a document at this link:  [How to Use Nano, the Linux Command Line Text Editor](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-nano-text-editor/)
:::
You can use whatever editor you want.

:::note Nano Quick Notes
 - `sudo nano cn-cnode` will start the program
 - use your keyboard arrows to navigate (not your mouse)
 - ctrl-o command-o (letter o) will save the contents of the file
 - give the file a name (`cn-node`)
 - ctrl-x command-x to exit the editor
:::

```
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/cn-node
```

You will be adding the following line to the **end** of the script. Make sure to either copy-n-paste or **very carefully** type in the command, you need it **exactly** as shown to work.

```
/usr/bin/java -jar '-Xms1024M' '-Xmx7G' '-Xss256K' /var/tessellation/cl-node.jar run-validator --collateral 0 & 
```

##### The above commands will:
- Add our environment variables
- Execute the command to startup our Constellation process on the Node.
- Run in the background

#### We are ready to create our service!

Using our **Nano** editor.
(You can use whatever editor you want.)

```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/node.service
```

You will be adding the following lines into our new **service file**.

```
[Unit]
Description=Constellation Node service
StartLimitBurst=50
StartLimitIntervalSec=0
[Service]
Type=forking
WorkingDirectory=/var/tessellation
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/cn-node
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Our service file is created, and we can exit Nano. (see quick ref above ðŸ‘†)

:::tip QUICK UNDERSTANDING
Normally, we would want to `enable` the `node.service` to start automatically on boot.  This would be done with the following command:
```
sudo systemctl enable node
```
**HOWEVER** this introduces a security vulnerability concerning our `Validator Node`.

In order to start the `service` properly, you will need to supply your `p12` passphrase.  Unless you have an automated process in place to fetch the passphrase securely via security focused external tool sets (out of scope of this document), your other alternative is to supply the `passphrase` in clear text.  This is **HIGHLY** undesirable method.  Your `p12` passphrase is a gateway into our Crypto wallets, finances, your `PRO Score`, etc.

As an **alternative** we will **not** automatically start the service on system boot.  We will add to our list of `to-dos` to manually start the process and supply the `passphrase` on each restart.

**Constellation Network Node Garage** [nodectl](../nodectl/install) `command line utility` will ease this process as a **better** solution.
:::


We will create a *temporary* environment variable prior to joining the network.  The export we do below will only survive the current working session, and it will be lost after we log out.  

```
export CL_PASSWORD="place_your_passphrase_here"
```
We can now **`start`** our **Node** service.
```
sudo systemctl start node
```

**Verification** step: Let's see if our service **started**.

```
sudo systemctl is-active node
```

**VERIFY** that the output of the command  above, is simply `active`.
```
active
```

### Our Node should be started.

#### Our node should be ready to join the HyperGraph!
