## Welcome to TestNet

Constellation Network is proud to introduce to you TestNet.  

Please refer to the **validator node** section of this documentation to learn how to build, deploy and operate your
validator node on the Constellation Network *Hypergraph*.  Utilizing your validator node you will learn how to 
join your node to the Constellation Network **TestNet**.  

While on the **TestNet** you will be able to:

- Safely and securely manipulate and test your validator node's 
functionality.
- Help other metagraph companies build, test and prepare to deploy their metagraphs.
- Help Constellation Network's **core** protocol team enhance **MainNet**.
