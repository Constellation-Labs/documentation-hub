This guide is specifically for troubleshooting your node if you are experiencing issues with the [upgrade_nodectl](/validate/automated/nodectl-commands#upgrade_nodectl) command.

## ◽ Introduction
As nodectl has evolved, so has its upgrade mechanism.

The [upgrade nodectl quick start](/validate/quick-start/upgrade-nodectl-quickstart) guide was written to support the latest version of nodectl, which may not fully address older versions that are no longer supported.

We hope this guide assists you in upgrading a node running an older version of nodectl to the most recent and recommended version.

## ◽ Version
To identify the version of nodectl you are running, execute the following command:
```
sudo nodectl version
```

## ◽ Upgrade Path
Please identify the next version in the upgrade path that is greater than the version running on your node, using the chart provided [here](/validate/automated/nodectl-upgrade-path#current-upgrade-path-table). 

Select the appropriate version to ensure your node is upgraded in the correct sequence.

## ◽ Upgrade nodectl utility
### Method 1
<p style={{fontSize:'.8em'}}>Replace &lt;version_you_found_here&gt; with the version you identified in the previous step.</p>

```
sudo nodectl upgrade_nodectl -v <version_you_found_here>
```

:::caution Command not found
Please proceed to **Method 2** if your version does not support the dedicated `-v` version option.
:::

### Method 2
- Open a web browser and navigate to the [nodectl release page](https://github.com/StardustCollective/nodectl/releases).
- Find your desired version by browsing the releases.
- Copy the `wget` link from the releases page and paste it into your node’s terminal to download the specific version.

## ◽ Upgrade your node
```
sudo nodectl upgrade
```
Follow the instruction prompts during the upgrade.  You may follow along using the [upgrade quick start guide](/validate/quick-start/upgrade-quickstart).

## ◽ Migration
If the version you are upgrading to requires a migration, nodectl will notify you with a warning during the upgrade process.

If the upgrade process does not require a migration, you will not receive a notification, and you can safely proceed to the next step.

##### If migration needed:
Press <kbd>y</kbd> to continue

*Optional*: <kbd>y</kbd> or <kbd>n</kbd> to review the new migrated configuration file.

## ◽ Repeat as necessary
If during the upgrade path determination [step](#-upgrade-path) you identified multiple versions ahead of your current version, you should return to the beginning of this guide and repeat the steps until you reach the desired version of nodectl.
