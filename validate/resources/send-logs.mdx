# Send Logs Guide

This guide is specifically for helping a Node Operator transmit logs from their Node to offer to Administrators, Developers, or other for analysis.

### ◽ SSH into Your Node
```
ssh -i /path/to/ssh/private/key nodeadmin@vps_ip_address
```
Refer to [SSH Explanation](/validate/validator/ssh-keys), [Mac SSH Guide](/validate/resources/accessMac), and [Windows SSH Guide](/validate/resources/accessWin)
for detailed understanding.

### Table of Contents - Options
1. [Using send_log command](#using-send-logs)
2. [Using prepare_file_download ](#using-prepare-file-download)

## Using Send Logs



### ◽ Issue send log command
```
sudo nodectl send_logs
```
You may choose your option based on the command reference [here](/validate/automated/nodectl-commands#send_logs). 

### ◽ What type of logs do you want to transmit?

This guide will choose the <kbd>1</kbd> option to upload the profile app logs from the `dag-l0` profile. *This is for example, and the Node Administrator may choose the option of their choice.*

Refer [here](/validate/quick-start/prerequisites#-profile-table) to look up the appropriate profile name if you need to access a specific Tessellation log instead of the nodectl log files.​

<MacWindow>
  1) dag-l0 app logs<br />
  2) dag-l1 app logs<br />
  3) nodectl logs<br />
  Q)uit<br />
</MacWindow>

### ◽ Choose the type of logs to transmit?

This guide will use the <kbd>s</kbd> option.  

This will find, compress, and prepare the current `app.log` from the `dag-l0` profile that holds the log files for the current `Tessellation` process running on your node.

:::note Other Options
To keep this guide as simple as possible, we will use only one example.

Keep in mind that other options may present different menu selections. Choose the one that best matches your scenario and use your best judgment for each option.

<MacWindow>
  S) Current Log (singular)<br />
  C) Current Logs (all)<br /> 
  B) Backup Logs<br /> 
  D) Specific Date<br /> 
  R) Specific Date Range<br /> 
  A) Archived Logs<br /> 
  X) Exit<br />
<br />
  KEY PRESS an option<br />
</MacWindow>

Allow nodectl to gather the logs, compress them, and present you with an upload option for the [tarball](/validate/validator/tarball-explained) that was created.

<br />
</MacWindow>

### ◽ Upload the logs

We will choose <kbd>y</kbd> to have the file uploaded to a temporary file sharing service (expiry time limited).

<MacWindow>
upload? [n]: <b>y</b><br /> 
</MacWindow>

If you would like to skip the upload, or the file share service is unavailable; you change choose the default **n** option and refer to the [Using Prepare File Download](#using-prepare-file-download) option.

### ◽ Supply Administrators, Devloper, System Engineer

You can now supply the URL to the entiy that is requesting the file.

<MacWindow>
Depending on the size of the tarball, this may take some time to upload<br />
please be patient...<br />

log tarball transferred to developers<br />
Please provide the following link to the developers for download and analysis.<br />
http://link.will.be.here<br />
Log tarball created and also located: /var/tessellation/uploads/<br />
file: xx-xx-xx-xx_xxxx-xx-xx-xx:xx:xxZ_logs.tar.gz<br />
<br />
You can also utilize the prepare_file_download command to setup this file<br /> 
for download to your local system.<br />
Command: sudo nodectl prepare_file_download help<br />
</MacWindow>

- Link to file: **http://link.will.be.here**
- Location on VPS: **xx-xx-xx-xx_xxxx-xx-xx-xx:xx:xxZ_logs.tar.gz**


## Using Prepare File Download

This command simplifies access to files owned by the VPS's root user, which may not have the necessary permissions for download by the non-root node administration account.

- Refer [here](/validate/automated/nodectl-commands#prepare_file_download) for command options. 

### ◽ Locate log files
We will need to know the exact directory location and name of log file.

If you are an advanced Node Administrator using a custom location to hold your log files (such as a network attached device), please make sure the location of the file is properly connected to your node and accessible.

The default location used by nodectl:

```
/var/tessellation/<profile_name>/logs/
```
<p style={{fontSize:'.8em'}}>&lt;profile_name&gt; should be your node's profile name associated with the logs being requested</p>

For the purpose of this guide, we will assume:
- The profile name as `dag-l0`.
- The log file requested as `app.log`.

### ◽ Request log file to be prepared
```
sudo nodectl prepare_file_download --type file /var/tessellation/dag-l0/logs/app.log
```

<MacWindow>
WARNING<br />
The following operation should be considered temporary and has the possibility of causing a minor security risk, on your Node.<br />
<br />
This command will create a copy of the requested file /var/tessellation/dag-l0/logs/app.log in the root of a non-root user's home directory, and set the permissions for access via a non-root user until removed.<br />
<br />
Once you have completed the backup of your file /var/tessellation/dag-l0/logs/app.log it is recommended that you return to your Node and re-run this command with the --cleanup option, to remove and secure your Node's nodeadmin user from accessing root files.<br />
<br />
Preparing [app.log] ........................... complete <br />                                                             
<br />
Found Files:<br />
- app.log<br />
<br />
p12 preparation ............................... complete <br />                                 
</MacWindow>

### ◽ Access File

You can now download your file on your own, using the file transfer application or protocol of your choosing.

You need further assistance to access and retreive the file you can refer to the backup/recovery guides.

- For [Macintosh](/validate/resources/p12-backup-mac)
- for [Windows](/validate/resources/p12-backup-win)

### ◽ Clean Up

It is highly recommended to cleanup your Node Administrator's root directory to keep disk space optimal and to not have superfluous files located where they should not be located.

To handle this we will append the `--cleanup` option to the end of our [previous](#-request-log-file-to-be-prepared) command.

```
sudo nodectl prepare_file_download --type file /var/tessellation/dag-l0/logs/app.log --cleanup
```

We can choose <kbd>y</kbd>.
