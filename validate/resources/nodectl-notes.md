```
Constellation Validator Node Notes:

To access our Node:
    open a terminal and enter:
    ssh -i /home/myuser/.ssh/myprivatekey nodeadmin@113.113.113.113
    
    This command will attempt to SSH into our VPS/Node 
    We will be challenged for access to supply the passphrase.
    passphrase: efg6abc13efg6

    If the command hangs or an error message stating 
    "refused" check to make sure that our firewall 
    on the VPS is properly setup to use the local 
    IP address of our system. During installation, 
    we restricted this down to a specific IP of our 
    local system, that may have changed.
