This process will guide you through changing the default SSH port 22 to a custom port for increased node security.

## Overview

**SSH** (Secure Shell Protocol) is the standard protocol used to gain remote access to computer systems (servers) for administration purposes. In our case, it's applicable mostly to **VPS** (Virtual Private Server) systems in the cloud.  

Utilizing **TCP/IP** (Transfer Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), a default connection is made via the widely known port **22**. This encrypted connection is established between the computer and server operator, from the local end of the connection (via terminal or bastion host) to the remote server. **SSH Key Pairs** are used to authenticate and provide the encryption/decryption mechanisms.  

### Centralized
In **centralized** infrastructure where there is a centralized security setup, it is easier to keep a well-known port in place. In order to gain access to the centralized network, you must traverse several layers of security before you are able to access these internal servers.

### Decentralized
In **decentralized** scenarios such as Constellation's Hypergraph network, the same level of centralized security is typically not obtainable. Instead, access to VPS systems are direct. This opens up vulnerability to nefarious actors from **DoS** (Denial of Service) attacks to unauthorized access attempts.

### Guidelines

:::danger Security
The custom port is a preventative measure to add more ambiguity to our VPS security, but offers no additional protection beyond that. It's important to keep a watchful eye over your validator node to ensure it is secure and running properly.
:::

:::note Custom port selection
This guide uses port **2222** as an example, but the node operator must select their own custom port (between **1025‚Äî7999** or **10000‚Äî65535**) to configure.

Ports **8000-9999** may be reserved for metagraphs and Global Layer 0, therefore that usage range is discouraged.
:::

## Configuration

### Before you Begin

Make sure you have your `p12` private keystore backed up before you continue this procedure!

See documentation to backup your `p12` for [Macintosh](/validate/resources/p12-backup-mac) or [Windows](/validate/resources/p12-backup-win).

### VPS Firewall Settings

:::danger Reminder
Port 2222 is used as an example; please select another custom port for your own configuration.
:::

##### Allow `port 2222` in your VPS firewall settings

Log into your VPS provider admin console and add a new rule allowing inbound connections to `port 2222`, restricting access only to the local IP. 

The firewall should contain an existing entry for SSH access on **port 22**. Do **NOT** delete the existing port `22` rule at this time. Copy this rule by adding custom `port 2222`. In the example, `113.113.113.113/32` is the local IP.

### SSH daemon config

Access your VPS node in order to update the `sshd_config` file. This is the default global configuration file for Debian OS.

:::note Remote Access
You can remind yourself how to access your VPS here for [Macintosh](/validate/resources/accessMac) or [Windows](/validate/resources/accessWin).
:::

#### Windows
Windows should use a terminal emulator such as **PuTTy**.

#### Mac
```
ssh -i <your_identify_file> nodeadmin@<your_ip_address>
```

From your VPS, we will access the `sshd_config` with **sudo** (super user).

```
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Navigate to the line where you see `#Port 22`, using the arrows on your keyboard.

If there is a `#` symbol (or comment) in front of `Port 22`, remove the `#` and replace the value 22 with a port number of your choice between 1025‚Äî7999 or 10,000‚Äî65535.

Let‚Äôs take the example `2222`.

![](/img/validator_nodes/ssh_port_config02.png)

On your keyboard, press <kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>o</kbd>.

![](/img/validator_nodes/ssh_port_config03.png)
üëÜüèΩ You should see this message at the bottom of the screen. 

Hit `Enter` to confirm, then press <kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>x</kbd> to close the text editor and return to command prompt.

### Confirm
With the following command below, we should see our updated `Port 2222` echoed to the screen.
```
sudo cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config | grep "Port 2222"
```
If you do not see `Port 2222` echoed to the screen, replace 2222 with your port number and repeat the steps above.

### Restart

Restart the SSH service:

```
sudo service sshd restart
```

### Before Testing and Confirming 

:::danger IMPORTANT 
Do **not** close your current terminal session!  In the event that something goes wrong, you will lose access to your VPS.  

( *Again make sure you have our p12 file backed up before continuing* )

Keeping the current session open will allow you **maintain your current connection**, until you verified you are up and running!

:::

### On Windows: PuTTy config

Update your terminal session configuration.

Since your `SSH port` has changed, the connection cannot be established any longer using `port 22`.  The SSH client needs to be updated to use your new port instead.

In **PuTTy**, load your `TestNet` profile configuration. Enter `2222` in the `Port` field.

![](/img/validator_nodes/ssh_port_config04.png)

Makes sure to save the new profile settings to your `TestNet` configuration, and test your connection with the updated port.

### On Mac: Terminal

The old command used to connect to your VPS node using the standard SSH `port 22` looked like this:
```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/cn-node-id nodeadmin@113.113.113.113
```

With this new command, specify your custom port to replace `2222`.
```
ssh -p 2222 -i ~/.ssh/cn-node-id nodeadmin@113.113.113.113
```

### Delete old SSH rule

Now that you have tested and successfully accessed your VPS node with your custom port, log into your VPS and delete the original `port 22` SSH rule from the firewall settings.

Done!
