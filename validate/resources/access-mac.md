## Reference
#### Definitions table

| Key Value | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| SSH Key File | cn_node_id
| Remote IP address of our VPS | `113.113.113.113` |
| SSH Key Pair File Location | `Users/.ssh/home/netmet` |
| Local System | The system used to access our remote VPS |
| Remote System | The system (VPS) we created in the prior documentation (DO, AWS, or GCP) that we are connecting to |
| [...] | Indicates redacted text and/or information |

:::danger REMINDER
We are `pretending` our remote location (VPS) has an external IP address of `113.113.113.113` and our user name is `netmet` ‚¨ÖÔ∏è do **not** use this!
:::

## Setup remote connection
### Open up a new terminal

1. Click on the desktop to change your top menu bar to `Finder` setup.
2. Click on `Go` and choose `Utilities`
![](/img/validator_nodes/nodes-mac-utilities.png)
3. Click on `Terminal`.
![](/img/validator_nodes/nodes-mac-terminal.png)

Lets use the **SSH** command to connect to our VPS. Issue the `ssh` command, including the `-i` option to tell SSH to use our specific `identity file` (ssh key file).

We will **not** be using a standard password to access our VPS; rather, a `SSH key pair` with a `passphrase`. We created this key pair in the previous sections ([macintosh](/validate/validator/creation-mac) or [windows](/validate/validator/creation-win)).

Issue these commands from your **Local System** to connect to the `IP address` of your **Remote System**.

:::info INFO
You may need to remove the ~/.ssh/ from the command if you did not save your SSH keys to the .ssh hidden directory.
:::

:::danger IMPORTANT INFORMATION
Different cloud providers use different default users to access your VPS for the first time.  **GCP** and **DO** use `root` while **AWS** uses `ubuntu`.   We will use `root` in our examples...  make sure to change this to `ubuntu` if you are using **AWS**, or review the documentation for the provider of your choice to determine their default username.
:::

### Issue connection command
```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/cn-node-id root@113.113.113.113
```

Enter your `SSH key passphrase` to access your remote node.

:::note
When you are entering in your password, the key strokes will **NOT** be shown. It may seem like you are not entering in anything. This is a security measure. 
:::
:::info Hint
Do not look at the screen as you are typing, this may help you to not make a mistake.
:::

Output will look like below

### Enter challenge passphrase

```
Enter passphrase for key '/home/netmet/.ssh/cn_node_id':
```

### Approve authenticity

We should now be challenged with a **WARNING** message about the **authenticity** of our **SSH keys**. We can accept this warning because we know that we just created them.

```
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_cn_node root@113.113.113.113
The authenticity of host '113.113.113.113 (113.113.113.113)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:rGh+b304FFJeXct7xYU000=dkfjrEskafjDDjancifO.
This key is not known by any other names
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
```

Access is granted!

Certain information was redacted from the output above.

:::note
From the instance output above above.  `root@nodegarage` : the `nodegarage` would show as the `hostname` that you supplied during the build process, in the previous steps. You may also see a `$` instead of a `#`, this does not matter.
:::

:::info 
You should **not** use `NodeGarage` as your `hostname`. However, it should not make a difference in performance or functionality.

##### Excellent!
You are accessing on your remote system through your local system.
