## Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Firewall 

We now will go through the steps required to lock down our new Google Cloud Platform instance.

We will setup the instance's firewall SG to only allow inbound connections necessary for our Node to operate properly.

Our outbound rules will be setup to only allow connections that were initiated from the instance.

#### VPC NETWORK

From the left main panel, scroll down to VPC Network ‚û°Ô∏è Firewall.

:::info
If necessary click on the ‰∏â to open the main panel

From the top you should notice we are inside our Project

You will also notice we have some default rules.

- Wide open access for `SSH`
- Wide open access for `RDP`

:::danger
You are dealing with crypto, so you want to have some tight security. You are in charge of your own DeFi here so if something goes wrong, no one is going to be able to help you.
:::

:::info 
This will affect your ability to access your Node from anywhere, but security needs to be taken into consideration when dealing with finances.
:::

Select the two default rules for SSH and RDP. Click the `DELETE` button to clean up these unwanted open rules.

#### NEW RULES

- Click on the `CREATE FIREWALL RULE` option.

Now comes a little harder section. But, we can get through it!

Click [here](https://www.whatismyip.com) to get redirected to a website (`https://www.whatipmyip.com`) that will identify your local IP address for you.  Mark this IP address down.  **It is an important IP to remember**.

You will use this IP address (your local IP address) as your `Source` for the both ports **`22`**.

:::note UNDERSTAND
This is going to restrict access to your Node from this location only. If you want access into your node from other locations (like roaming on your mobile device), you will need to create a more complex rule here (out of scope of this document). 
:::

:::danger IMPORTANT
The less restrictive your access, the more vulnerable your Node becomes.

Let's walk through the two Inbound Rules that we will need.

#### NAME

- Give our first rule a name.

![](/img/validator_nodes/node-gcp-sg5.png)

#### ACCOUNT

- Assign this rule to our Specific service account.

![](/img/validator_nodes/node-gcp-sg6.png)

#### SERVICE ACCOUNT
- Select `In this project`
- We don't need a service account so we will choose `No service account`

![](/img/validator_nodes/node-gcp-sg7.png)

#### IP ADDRESS

- Enter in our IP address that we retrieved from [whatismyip.com](https://www.whatismyip.com)

- Add the `/32` to the ending

:::danger
Do not use 113.113.113.113/32, this is just an example
:::

![](/img/validator_nodes/node-gcp-sg8.png)

- Add our SSH port `22` rule back into our rule set, but this time lock it down to only allow our local IP inbound.

![](/img/validator_nodes/node-gcp-sg9.png)

All the other options on this `Create Firewall Rule` section should be left as is, no need to alter them unless you are an *advanced* user and want to update elements to suit your needs.

- Click on `CREATE`

#### VERIFY SSH RULE

#### NEW RULE

Now, go through the exact same process as the üëÜ rule for our next rule.

- Click on the `CREATE FIREWALL RULE` option

![](/img/validator_nodes/node-gcp-sg12.png)

- Add a name to the our firewall rule

![](/img/validator_nodes/node-gcp-sg13.png)

Let's assign this rule to our Specified service account.

![](/img/validator_nodes/node-gcp-sg14.png)

- Select `In this project`
- We don't need a Service Account, so we will choose `No service account`

![](/img/validator_nodes/node-gcp-sg15.png)

We will tell our rule to let anything access these ports from the internet. Add `/0` to the ending of `0.0.0.0`. 
Example: `0.0.0.0/0`

![](/img/validator_nodes/node-gcp-sg16.png)

- Choose the Specified protocols and `ports` option
- Check the `tcp:` box
- Enter in `9000` followed by a `-` (dash) and then `9001` (no spaces)

![](/img/validator_nodes/node-gcp-sg17.png)

All the other options on this Create Firewall Rule section should be left as is, no need to alter them unless you are an advanced user and want to update elements to suit your needs.

- Click on `CREATE`

### MAINNET, INTEGRATIONET, OR TESTNET LAUNCH REQUIREMENT
It is highly recommended that you use `nodectl` to install and control/admin your Node.

Please add to your firewall configuration ports `9010-9011` to allow access to your MainNet, IntegrationNet or TestNet Validator Node's Layer1 connection.  To accomplish this, repeat the exact same steps you used to open up ports `9000-9001`.

#### VERIFY ALL OUR RULES

Our firewall security group is now properly setup to work with your future Node. Congrats!
