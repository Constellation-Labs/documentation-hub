## Securing our EC2 Instance

We need to `restrict` the access to our **EC2 Instance** down to just the essentials necessary for our future **Node** to operate properly. We do not want our EC2 instance `wide open` and `vulnerable` to malicious actors out on the Internet.

Your instances Firewall rules are called `SGs` for `security groups`.  This is similar to software firewall rule sets.

Let's get right to it...

If you are a visual learner, you can access and view a YouTube series dedicated to this process.  SSH Key Generation Series - **Video 4b** by NetMet.

Please like and subscribe to support NetMet's work and to be alerted to new content specifically applied to **Constellation Network**, in the future.

:::note
If you choose the YouTube Series, it is highly recommended to watch the entire series, from the beginning.
:::

:::danger VERY IMPORTANT FOR MAINNET 2.0 LAUNCH
These documents reference creating a single layer 0 or metagraph.  For the launch of MainNet 2.0, you will installing a **DUAL** layer - `layer0` and `layer1` - validator Node.  You will need to add some extra firewall rules to accommodate this initial requirement.   Please refer to the end of this documentation for these additions.  The YouTube Series does not cover these extra rules.

### Open Compute EC2 Console 
Click on the`Services` button to start our process.

![](/img/validator_nodes/node-aws-ec2-services1.png)

From the new drop down box, choose the option **`Compute`**.

![](/img/validator_nodes/node-aws-ec2-services2.png)

Choose the option **`EC2`** from the **Compute** section.

![](/img/validator_nodes/node-aws-ec2-services3.png)

### Region

We need to pick a `region` to host our EC2 instance.

![](/img/validator_nodes/node-aws-ec2-3.png)

### Access our EC2 details

From the `instance dashboard`, click the link corresponding to your **`instance id`**.

![](/img/validator_nodes/node-aws-ec2-launch3.png)

This will show all the `details` of our instance.

### Access the Security Group Console

  - Select the **`Security tab`**.
  - Select the link corresponding to the **`security group`** that should have been automatically assigned to your **`instance`**.

![](/img/validator_nodes/node-aws-sg4.png)

This will take us to our **security group**.

### Amazon Web Services OUTBOUND requests

We are going to `allow` our instance to access `all` outbound requests. This set up will allow connections that initiate from your EC2 instance outbound. We will not change them. 

:::info Advance Concept
If you are a more advanced user, you can alter these rules to your liking.  AWS will monitor all inbound requests that are not allowed by associating them with an outbound request.  If an incoming TCP or UDP packet attempts to reach your instance without an associated outbound request, it will be automatically denied.

This is what is called `stateful`.
:::

#### Amazon Web Services INBOUND requests

We want to **`lock down`** our `incoming access`. We will only allow the core **Constellation Network** rules inbound.

- Click on the **`Inbound Rules`** tab.
- Click the **`Edit Inbound Rules`** button.

![](/img/validator_nodes/node-aws-sg5.png)

#### INBOUND RULES
We want to **add** inbound rules.

The next section can get a little complicated. But, we can get through it! 

What you want to do is first, click on [www.whatismyip.com](https://www.whatismyip.com) and write down your `My Public IPv4 IP address`.

You will use this **IP address** as your Source for port **`22`**.

:::info IMPORTANT 
This is going to restrict access to your Node to your `local location` only.  If you want access into your node from other locations (like roaming on your mobile device), you will need to create a `more complex rule set` here (out of scope of this document). 
:::
:::danger DANGER
The less restrictive your access, the more vulnerable your Node becomes.
:::

Let's add `2` Inbound Rules.

We will leave the **`SSH`** as our `Type`, and then begin to enter in our **`IP address`** (obtained from the [www.whatismyip.com](https://www.whatismyip.com) step ðŸ‘†).

As you fill it in, the search box should populate and add the **`/32`** for us. Select (click) the option so it populates just below the search box.

:::info Previous Launch Wizard
In the [EC2 (Part 1)](createEC2.md) we had an optional section to associate your local system's IP address. 

If this was followed, your SSH connection may already be set correctly
:::

![](/img/validator_nodes/node-aws-sg6.png)

We want to add our second `inbound` rule.

![](/img/validator_nodes/node-aws-sg7.png)

### Constellation SG Rules

For this rule, we will add a port range with a `-` (dash) in-between the numbers to get **`9000-9001`**.

We will allow Everything to hit this port: **`0.0.0.0/0`**

![](/img/validator_nodes/node-aws-sg8.png)

Our **inbound rules** will look something like this ðŸ‘‡

![](/img/validator_nodes/node-aws-sg9.png)

Click on **`Save rules`**.

**[REPEAT](#constellation-sg-rules)** This process for ports `9010-9011`.

:::info
Ports 9000 and 9001 are used for a Public (9000) and Peer-to-Peer (9001) **API** access.   Ports 9000 and 9001 are configurable and can be independent (to your needs) on the Hypergraph Global Layer0 or State Channel network you connect to.  Node Operators will need to learn what ports are opened for access to the State Channels, and update their firewall (change) accordingly.

The port numbers selected should not matter; however, for non-advanced users, using the ports mentioned in the above section is recommended.
:::

## MainNet 2.0 Launch Requirements

It is **highly** recommended that you use `nodectl` to install and control/admin your Node.

Please add to your firewall configuration ports `9010-9011` to allow access to your MainNet 2.0 Validator Node's `Layer1` connection.  To accomplish this, repeat the exact same steps you used to open up ports `9000-9001`.

#### Final Firewall Table 

| Type	| Protocol	| Port Range	| Sources |
| ----  | -----| ----- | ---- |
| Inbound	| TCP	| 22	| your local ip address /32 |
| Inbound	| TCP	| 9000-9001	| All IPv4 IPv6
| Inbound	| TCP	| 9010-9011	| All IPv4 IPv6

| Type	| Protocol	| Port Range	| Sources |
| ----  | -----| ----- | ---- |
| Outbound	| ICMP	| All Ports	| All IPv4 IPv6 |
| Outbound	| All TCP	| All Ports |	All IPv4 IPv6 |
| Outbound	| All UDP	| All Ports	| All IPv4 IPv6 |


### WAY TO GO! You are done.
We can now move on to access our Node!
