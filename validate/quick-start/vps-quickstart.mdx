# Introduction

This guide is specifically for setting up your [VPS](/validate/validator/vps) to build a Constellation Network node. It is a general guide.

## â—½ Before We Begin

This guide does not include cloud provider-specific steps or images, for a more detailed **provider specific** step-by-step guides click [here](/validate/setup-guides/). 

You should use this guide to understand what needs to be accomplished and adapt it to your specific cloud providerâ€™s control panel. The guide offers opinionated advice with sensible defaults.

## â—½ Create SSH Keys

Please access the [Create SSH Key quick start guide](/validate/quick-start/ssh-quickstart) to build your SSH key pair. 

This is necessary to have in place before continuing this guide.

## â—½ Select Project
Choose or create a new project that will be used to organize your VPS creations inside of.

:::caution Missing Projects
Not all cloud providers require this step, skip if not found.

## â—½ Create a Firewall

Create your firewall or security group policy first. 

- [AWS](/validate/setup-guides/aws/sg) should create a security group.
- [GCP](/validate/setup-guides/gcp/sg) should create a firewall.
- [Digitial Ocean](/validate/setup-guides/do/sg-droplet) should create a firewall.
- [Hetnzer](/validate/setup-guides/do/sg-droplet#create-rule-set) should create a firewall (you can follow the DO step-by-step).

## â—½ Choose a Region

Choose a region that is closest to your location.

## â—½ Pick an image

Choose `Ubuntu 22.04`

## â—½ Tenancy

Choose shared CPU or shared Tenancy.

## â—½ Choose Instance type

Pick an instance size that meets or exceeds the [specification requirements](/validate/validator/specs) to run a Constellation Network node.

## â—½ Upload your SSH key

Open your public key SSH key to view its contents.

- replace `myuser` with your username.
- replace `ConstellationNodeKeyPair.pub` with your public key name.

<TabItem value="Choose" label="Choose">
Please choose <b>Windows</b> or <b>Macintosh</b> platform.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Windows" label="Windows">

```
notepad \Users\myuser\.ssh\ConstellationNodeKeyPair.pub 
```

<WinCommandPrompt>
C:\Users\myuser>notepad \Users\myuser\.ssh\ConstellationNodeKeyPair.pub
</WinCommandPrompt>
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Mac" label="Macintosh">

```
open -a TextEdit ./.ssh/ConstellationNodeKeyPairTest.pub
```

<MacWindow>
myuser@myuser-MacBook ~ % open -a TextEdit ./.ssh/ConstellationNodeKeyPairTest.pub
</MacWindow>
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

The ðŸ‘† command, will open an editor that will contain the contents of your `public` SSH key.  It should *most likely* **start** with either:

- ssh-rsa
- ssh-ed25519

It should **end** with your SSH key comment. *If follwing directly with our guides*, it is `ConstellationNetwork`.

##### Digitial Ocean and Hetzner
1. Click on the upload or new SSH key <kbd>button</kbd> option
1. Copy the contents of your public key into the modal and add the key.

##### AWS
1. Use the Actions menu from the Region you are building your VPS (EC2) instance within and select `Import key pair`
1. Copy the contents of your public key into the modal and add the key.

## â—½ Assign External IP address

Specific to AWS, you will need to assign an EIP (Elastic IP) to allow your future Node to persist on the Internet.

If you are not using AWS, you can skip this step.

1. Choose Elastic IP from the side menu.
1. Choose your Region.
1. Allocate an EIP.
1. Associate your EIP your instance after the instance is created through the action menu.

## â—½ Create your VPS

Click on the create button.

## â—½ Complete

Your VPS should now begin its creation and you should be able to access it shortly via SSH.

You may return to the [Quick Start Guides](/validate/quick-start/index) to choose the cluster you would like to build your node for participation in.
