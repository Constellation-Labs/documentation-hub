No action required, you can wait for the installation to complete, and the ending/final screen of instructions.

<MacWindow>
Please follow the instructions below, as indicated<br />
<br />
1) Submit your NodeID to Constellation Admins.<br />
2) Collateralize your Node.<br />
3) sudo nodectl check_seedlist -p dag-l0<br />
4) sudo nodectl restart -p all<br />

ðŸš‘ <span style={{fontSize:'1.2em',fontWeight:800}}>&nbsp;Leave this screen up and remote terminal window open!</span>

## â—½ Test Access 
1. Leave your `root` or `ubuntu` user connected to your Node's terminal. 
1. Open a new local terminal and attempt a second SSH remote connection to your Node using your `nodeadmin` user and passphrase as created in the [SSH into Your VPS](#-ssh-into-your-vps).

After confirming you have access via `nodeadmin` you can move to the next step.

## â—½ Submit your Node Details

1. Connect to the **Constellation Network Official** Discord Support Server.  
1. Reach out to an Administrator.
1. Supply your Lattice account email.
1. Supply and request to have your `nodeid` appended to the IntegrationNet Hypergraph access seed list.

You will see your Node ID, displayed on the [instructional screen](#-wait-for-installation-to-complete) at the end of the installation.
