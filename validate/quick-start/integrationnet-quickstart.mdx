# IntegrationNet Quick Start

This guide is specifically for setting up your IntegrationNet Node, and is opinionated with sensible defaults. 

This guide will use the Windows command prompt or Macintosh terminal.

## ◽ Prerequisite

Choose and provision your VPS.

Refer to the [VPS Build Quick Start](/validate/quick-start/vps-quickstart) guide.

## ◽ Prepare for SSH connection
On Windows, please open a [command prompt](/validate/quick-start/ssh-quickstart#-prepare-to-create-key-pair).<br />
On Mac, please open a [terminal](/validate/quick-start/ssh-quickstart#-prepare-to-create-key-pair).

## ◽ SSH into Your VPS
```
ssh -i /path/to/ssh/private/key nodeadmin@vps_ip_address
```
Refer to [SSH Explanation](/validate/validator/ssh-keys), [Mac SSH Guide](/validate/resources/accessMac), and [Windows SSH Guide](/validate/resources/accessWin)
for detailed understanding.

## ◽ Update OS
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
```

## ◽ Reboot
```
sudo reboot now
```
SSH into your VPS again using the `default` user set by your VPS provider (e.g., `root` or `ubuntu`).

## ◽ Install nodectl 
**Node Control Utility Program v2.15.0**
```
sudo wget -N https://github.com/stardustcollective/nodectl/releases/download/v2.15.0/nodectl_x86_64 -P /usr/local/bin -O /usr/local/bin/nodectl; sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/nodectl; sudo nodectl -v
```

## ◽ Start Tessellation Installation
```
sudo nodectl install --quick-install
```

## ◽ Select Cluster to Configure/Join

- Choose <kbd>2</kbd> (`integrationnet [HyperGraph]`)

## ◽ Decline P12 Migration Request

- We will choose <kbd>n</kbd> to decline the migration.

## ◽ Node Administration Account Password

Input and confirm the `nodeadmin`'s new strong password that will be used to administer your Node.

:::note Password Entry
  *You will **not** see the password output or the \* character while entering your password. This is a Linux level security feature.*
:::

## ◽ P12 Key Store Passphrase

Input and confirm a complex passphrase that will be used to unlock 
your Node's ability to access the network and to administer your Node's wallet.

- Must have at least 1 `uppercase letter`
- Must have at least 1 `lowercase letter`
- Must have at least 1 `number`
- Must have at least 1 `special character`

<hr style={{width:`55%`}}/>

- Must **NOT** have any `spaces`
- Must **NOT** have a `section sign` **&#167;**
- Must **NOT** have a `dollar sign` **$**

## ◽ Wait for Installation to Complete

No action required, you can wait for the installation to complete.

<MacWindow>
Please follow the instructions below, as indicated<br />
<br />
1) Submit your NodeID to Constellation Admins.<br />
2) Collateralize your Node.<br />
3) sudo nodectl check_seedlist -p dag-l0<br />
4) sudo nodectl restart -p all<br />
5) Log out and log back in with as nodeadmin with your new nodeadmin password.<br />
</MacWindow>

🚑 <span style={{fontSize:'1.2em',fontWeight:800}}>&nbsp;Leave this screen up and remote terminal window open!</span>

## ◽ Test Access 
1. Leave your `root` or `ubuntu` user connected to your Node's terminal. 
1. Open a new local terminal and attempt a second SSH remote connection to your Node using your `nodeadmin` user and passphrase as created in the [SSH into Your VPS](#-ssh-into-your-vps).

After confirming you have access via `nodeadmin` you can move to the next step.

## ◽ Submit your Node Details

1. Connect to the **Constellation Network Official** Discord Support Server.  
1. Reach out to an Administrator.
1. Supply and request to have your `nodeid` appended to the IntegrationNet Hypergraph access seed list.

You will see your Node ID, displayed on the [instructional screen](#-wait-for-installation-to-complete) at the end of the installation.

```

## ◽ Back Up Your Node P12
Refer to these guides
- [p12 backup guide Windows](/validate/resources/p12-backup-win)
- [p12 backup guide Mac](/validate/resources/p12-backup-mac) 

## ◽ Secure Storage of Passwords
Ensure that you have recorded all the passphrase(s) and other pertinent information via your notes, to a secured air gapped location.

You may reference our [Node Operator Notes](/validate/resources/nodectl-notes) for an idea on what to record.

## ◽ Close Terminals
After completing the [access test](#-test-access) **successfully**, you can close out all terminal sessions, leaving only your `nodeadmin` connected terminal session open.

:::warning IMPORTANT 
Your Node will no longer be accessible via the `root` or default `ubuntu` account you originally setup your Node to access.
:::

## ◽ Setup Reward Distribution 
You will need to access your Lattice account and supply Constellation Network's Lattice Team with:
- Your IntegrationNet `Node ID`.
- The real `Wallet` that will be used for `$DAG` reward distribution. 
- A `Wallet` (*this can be the same wallet*) that has `250,000 $DAG` tokens, to satify your collateral requirements. 

:::info FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING
The IntegrationNet cluster is a **TestNet** and therefore the `$DAG` tokens used on this cluster hold no real world value.  They are test tokens.  

The reward distribution for this network is distributed daily to a wallet address identified by the validator Node Operator through their Lattice account.
:::

## ◽ Congratulations 
Your Node installation is complete.

## ◽ Next Steps
:::danger IMPORTANT
You will need to wait for your node's nodeid, that was [submitted here](#-submit-your-node-details), to be added the seed list (access/authorization list) before you can join the cluster.
:::
Follow the [first time Connection quick start guide](/validate/quick-start/online-quick-start) to bring your node on the network.
