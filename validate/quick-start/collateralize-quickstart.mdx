# Collateralize Quick Start Guide

This guide is specifically for setting up your Validator Node's wallet with the proper collateral requirements.

## ◽ SSH into Your Node

ssh -i /path/to/ssh/private/key nodeadmin@vps_ip_address
```
Refer to [SSH Explanation](/validate/validator/ssh-keys), [Mac SSH Guide](/validate/resources/accessMac), and [Windows SSH Guide](/validate/resources/accessWin)
for detailed understanding.

## ◽ Export Private Key
```
sudo nodectl export_private_key -p <profile_name>
```

- Refer [here](/validate/quick-start/prerequisites#-profile-table) to lookup `<profile_name>`. 
- Copy down the `64B` private key.

## ◽ Install Stargazer Wallet
Install on [Chrome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEnrxijiqg).

There are [additional videos on YouTube](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+do+i+install+stargazer+wallet&sca_esv=how+do+i+install+stargazer+wallet) that can guide you through the installation of Stargazer.

## ◽ Import Wallet to Stargazer
Follow [this guide](https://intercom.help/constellation-network/en/articles/5677935-how-do-i-import-an-existing-wallet-using-a-private-key-json-file)

## ◽ Transfer Funds

#### Suggested Steps
1. Transfer a single $DAG token into your newly imported wallet.
1. Review the contents of your wallet through the Stargazer wallet application and confirm that the $DAG has appeared in your wallet.
1. Review the contents of your wallet directly from your node and confirm that the $DAG has appeared in your wallet.
```
sudo nodectl dag -p <profile_name>
```

Once you have confirmed that the transfer was successful, you may proceed to populate your wallet with the full amount of $DAG. You can do this through multiple transfers or a single large transfer, depending on your comfort level.

Once complete, review the contents again on both the Stargazer wallet application and from our node.

## ◽ Complete
