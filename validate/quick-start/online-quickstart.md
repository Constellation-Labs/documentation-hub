# First Time Connection Quick Start Guide

This guide is specifically for connecting a Validator Node to a Constellation Network Hypergraph or metagraph cluster for the first time.

## â—½ Prerequisites 

Please review the [checklist and profile descriptions](/validate/quick-start/prerequisites) for a better understanding of how this document works.

We will use `dag-l0` as our profile name throughout the guide. When necessary, this should be changed to match your Node's [profile](/validate/quick-start/prerequisites#-profile-table).

## â—½ SSH into Your VPS
Review your [notes](/validate/resources/nodectl-notes) for the connection string.

```
ssh -i /path/to/ssh/private/key nodeadmin@vps_ip_address
```
Refer to [SSH Explanation](/validate/validator/ssh-keys), [Mac SSH Guide](/validate/resources/accessMac), and [Windows SSH Guide](/validate/resources/accessWin)
for detailed understanding.

## â—½ Verify you are on the seed list
```
sudo nodectl check_seedlist -p dag-l0
```
<MacWindow>
NODE ID FOUND ON SEED LIST<br />
True
</MacWindow>

If you are not on the seed list, please ðŸ›‘ **stop** here and contact a Discord Administrator Team Lead from the Constellation Network Official Discord server.  

You must wait for the next network cluster restart that includes a seed list update.

## â—½ Preform an upgrade 

Utilizing the [upgrade](/validate/automated/nodectl-commands#upgrade) command, we can take care of most of the necessary items to ensure our node can join the cluster properly.

```
sudo nodectl upgrade -ni
```
The `-ni` will run the upgrade in `non-interactive mode`, using all the default values. 

## â—½ Single Layer1 Nodes

Layer1 metagraph validators **SHOULD** skip to [this](#-verify-your-status) step at the time. 

## â—½ Hybrid Nodes
[Hybrid nodes](/validate/validator/specs#hybrid-node) must be in `Ready` state on layer0 before completing a full connection cluster join.

:::danger EXPECTED FAILURE
After your node finishes connection steps to join the layer0 Hypergraph, you will see your Node attempt to connect to the layer1 profile and fail.  **This is expected, and can be ignored**. 
:::

A new Node must go through the process of obtaining the entire [snapshot chain](/metagraphs/concepts/snapshots) from the cluster. Layer1 is not allowed on the cluster until the layer0 cluster has its entire chain.

During this stage, your Node will transition into `SessionStarted` and then transition again to `DownloadInProgress` state.

<p style={{fontSize:".7em"}}>There are other states that the node may transition into; however, these two states are the most obvious to see.</p>

## â—½ DownloadInProgress

After the upgrade completes, our goal is to see that our node has reached `DownloadInProgress` state.  We will verify this by issuing this command.

```
sudo nodectl status -p dag-l0
```
<MacWindow>
JOIN STATE<br />
DownloadInProgress
</MacWindow>

Repeat the command if you see `SessionStarted` until you reach `DownloadInProgress`.

## â—½ Wait for Ready
Our node now has to wait several days to complete the process of downloading all [snapshots](/metagraphs/concepts/snapshots) before it transitions itself into `Ready` state.

You may continue to the next optional step to speed this process up or you should bookmark this page and return to continue your first time connection, after you reach `Ready` state.

Our node now needs to wait several days to complete the process of downloading all [snapshots](/metagraphs/concepts/snapshots) before it transitions into the `Ready` state.

You may proceed to the next optional step to speed up this process, or bookmark this page and return once your node reaches the `Ready` state to continue your first-time connection.

## â—½ Execute Starchiver (optional)

To reduce the time to obtain your entire snapshot chain **considerably**, so you may join the cluster properly, you can utilize the [starchiver](https://github.com/StardustCollective/Starchive-Extractor) utility.
```
sudo nodectl execute_starchiver -p dag-l0 --restart
```
While the Starchiver utility is running, you should keep a diligent eye on your node to make sure it completes successfully.

:::caution ðŸš§ Caution
**Starchiver is not a Constellation Network supported Utility.** For troubleshooting or other needs, you can reach out to the owner of the project through the [Github Repository](https://github.com/StardustCollective/Starchive-Extractor).  You may also contact the developers through the Constellation Network Official Discord server.

**Use at your own risk**
:::

## â—½ Verify your status
Once your Node has completed downloading the snapshot chain, it will transition from `DownloadInProgess` to `Ready` by going through several intermediary stages.

You can review your Node's status by issuing the [status](/validate/automated/nodectl-commands#status) command.  We are looking for two main status output values:
1. JOIN STATE
1. IN CONSENSUS

```
sudo nodectl status -p dag-l0
```

#### Layer0

<MacWindow>
JOIN STATE<br />
Ready
</MacWindow>
<MacWindow>
IN CONSENSUS<br />
True
</MacWindow>

#### Layer1

<MacWindow>
JOIN STATE<br />
ReadyToJoin
</MacWindow>

If your Node has not reached the `Ready` stage, you can continuously watch the Node's status by utilizing the `-w` (watch) option.  

Make sure when you are done watching, you use the <kbd>q</kbd> to gracefully exit the `status` command.

```
sudo nodectl status -p dag-l0 -w 120
```

## â—½ Join layer1

If your Node is in `ReadyToJoin`:
```
sudo nodectl join -p dag-l1
```
If your Node is in any state other than `Ready`:
```
sudo nodectl restart -p dag-l1
```
