# Quick Start Prerequisites

This document is intended to outline the steps that should be completed before using any of the validator node quick start guides on this documentation portal.

It does **NOT** include the [New Installation Start Guides](/validate/quick-start/index) or [Step-by-Step Guides](/validate/automated/install/nodectl-install-types). If you do not already have a node set up, you may skip this document and proceed directly to the [guide](/validate/quick-start/index) that pertains to your particular setup.

## ◽ Check List  ✅

- Your Node is built with nodectl installed. 
  - [Quick Start Guides](/validate/quick-start/index).
  - [Step-by-Step Guides](/validate/automated/install/nodectl-install-types).
- Have your Node accessible via [remote SSH](/validate/validator/ssh-keys).
- Your Node's **nodeid** (public key) has been submitted to Constellation Network and confirmed it was placed on the authentication seed list.
  - IntegrationNet specific:
     - Lattice account is setup.
     - NodeID registered on Lattice account.
     - Wallet with collateral requirements provided.
     - Wallet to distribute rewards provided. 
- If your Hypergraph or metagraph requires collateral, your Node's wallet is properly [collateralized](/validate/quick-start/collateralize). 
  - IntegrationNet specific:
     - Wallet with collateral requirements provided.
- Your [firewall ports](/validate/resources/firewall-access) are properly opened.

## ◽ Profile Table

| Profile Name | Layer Type | Description |
| ------------ | ---------- | ----------- | 
| dag-l0 | 0 | MainNet and TestNet profile for the layer0 global Hypergraph |
| dag-l1 | 1 | MainNet and TestNet profile for the currency layer1 Hypergraph |
| intnet-l0 | 0 | IntegrationNet profile for the layer0 global Hypergraph |
| intnet-l1 | 1 | IntegrationNet profile for the currency layer1 Hypergraph |
| dor-dl1 | 1 | Dor metagraph profile for the data layer1 metagraph |

:::note Profile Documentation Default
The documentation will most probably refer to `dag-l0` from the MainNet cluster profile within nodectl's default profile names, throughout the documentation.  You should substitute this for the matching profile of your cluster.
