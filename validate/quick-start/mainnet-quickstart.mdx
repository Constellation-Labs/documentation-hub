# MainNet Quick Start

This guide is specifically for setting up your MainNet Node, and is opinionated with sensible defaults.

## â—½ Choose VPS Provider
Refer to the [Constellation Network Setup Guides](/validate/setup-guides/) for choosing a VPS provider.

## â—½ Setup Firewall
| direction       | port  | description
|-----------------|-------| -----------
| inbound | 9000 | public api layer0
| inbound | 9001 | p2p api layer0
| inbound | 9010 | public api layer1
| inbound | 9011 | p2p api layer1
| outbound  | all | Tune to your needs

Refer to these guides on [Digital Ocean](/validate/setup-guides/do/sg-droplet), [AWS](/validate/setup-guides/aws/sg), and [Hetzner](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/firewalls/getting-started/creating-a-firewall/).

:::note
Setting up your firewall policy prior to building your VPS will save time.

## â—½ Provision Your VPS

**Minimum specification for your [VPS](/validate/validator/vps)**

Refer to the [specification](/validate/validator/specs#hybrid-node-hardware-requirements) document for validation.

Suggested OS: **Ubuntu 22.04**

*Ubuntu 24.04 is currently not supported.*

## â—½ SSH into Your VPS
```
ssh -i /path/to/ssh/private/key nodeadmin@vps_ip_address
```
Refer to [SSH Explanation](/validate/validator/ssh-keys), [Mac SSH Guide](/validate/resources/accessMac), and [Windows SSH Guide](/validate/resources/accessWin)
for detailed understanding.

## â—½ Update OS
```
sudo apt -y update && sudo apt -y upgrade
```

## â—½ Reboot
```
sudo reboot now
```
SSH into your VPS again using the `default` user set by your VPS provider (e.g., `root` or `ubuntu`).

## â—½ Install nodectl 
**Node Control Utility Program v2.15.2**
```
sudo wget -N https://github.com/stardustcollective/nodectl/releases/download/v2.15.2/nodectl_x86_64 -P /usr/local/bin -O /usr/local/bin/nodectl; sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/nodectl; sudo nodectl -v
```

## â—½ Start Tessellation Installation
```
sudo nodectl install --quick-install
```

## â—½ Select Cluster to Configure/Join

- Choose <kbd>1</kbd> (`mainnet [HyperGraph]`)

## â—½ Decline P12 Migration Request

- We will choose <kbd>n</kbd> to decline the migration.

## â—½ Node Administration Account Password

Input and confirm the `nodeadmin`'s new strong password that will be used to administer your Node.

:::note Password Entry
  *You will **not** see the password output or the \* character while entering your password. This is a Linux level security feature.*
:::

## â—½ P12 Keystore Passphrase

Input and confirm a complex passphrase that will be used to unlock 
your Node's ability to access the network and to administer your Node's wallet.

- Must have at least 1 `uppercase letter`
- Must have at least 1 `lowercase letter`
- Must have at least 1 `number`
- Must have at least 1 `special character`

<hr style={{width:`55%`}}/>

- Must **NOT** have any `spaces`
- Must **NOT** have a `section sign` **&#167;**
- Must **NOT** have a `dollar sign` **$**

## â—½ Wait for Installation to Complete

No action required, you can wait for the installation to complete.

<MacWindow>
Please follow the instructions below, as indicated<br />
<br />
1) Submit your NodeID to Constellation Discord Admins.<br />
2) Collateralize your Node's wallet.<br />
3) Stay logged in to this VPS terminal session.
4) Open new terminal.
5) Confrim ability to log in as: nodeadmin
6) Log out of this original terminal session.<br />
7) Wait for next cluster restart<br />
8) Confirm your node's status<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- sudo nodectl check_seedlist -p dag-l0<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- sudo nodectl restart -p all<br />
</MacWindow>

ðŸš‘ <span style={{fontSize:'1.2em',fontWeight:800}}>&nbsp;Leave this screen up and remote terminal window open!</span>

## â—½ Test Access 
1. Leave your `root` or `ubuntu` user connected to your Node's terminal. 
1. Open a new local terminal and attempt a second SSH remote connection to your Node using your `nodeadmin` user and passphrase as created in the [SSH into Your VPS](#-ssh-into-your-vps).

After confirming you have access via `nodeadmin` you can move to the next step.

## â—½ Submit your Node Details

1. Connect to the **Constellation Network Official** Discord Support Server.  
1. Reach out to an Administrator.
1. Supply and request to have your `nodeid` appended to the MainNet Hypergraph access seed list.

You will see your Node ID, displayed on the [instructional screen](#-wait-for-installation-to-complete) at the end of the installation.

```

## â—½ Back Up Your Node P12
Refer to these guides
- [p12 backup guide Windows](/validate/resources/p12-backup-win)
- [p12 backup guide Mac](/validate/resources/p12-backup-mac) 

## â—½ Secure Storage of Passwords
Ensure that you have recorded all the passphrase(s) and other pertinent information via your notes, to a secured air gapped location.

You may reference our [Node Operator Notes](/validate/resources/nodectl-notes) for an idea on what to record.

## â—½ Close Terminals
After completing the [access test](#-test-access) **successfully**, you can close out all terminal sessions, leaving only your `nodeadmin` connected terminal session open.

:::warning IMPORTANT 
Your Node will no longer be accessible via the `root` or default `ubuntu` account you originally setup your Node to access.
:::

## â—½ Collateralize your Node
Refer to the [collateralize your node start guide](/validate/quick-start/collateralize-quickstart).

## â—½ Congratulations 
Your Node installation is complete.

## â—½ Next Steps
:::danger IMPORTANT
You will need to wait for your node's nodeid, that was [submitted here](#-submit-your-node-details), to be added the seed list (access/authorization list) before you can join the cluster.
:::
Follow the [first time Connection quick start guide](/validate/quick-start/online-quick-start) to bring your node on the network.
