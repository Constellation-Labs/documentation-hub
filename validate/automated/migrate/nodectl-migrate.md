## Introduction

### Bottom Line

This documentation will offer the Node Operator a step-by-step walk through designed to help perform a **new** installation with an **existing** p12 private keystore.

### Explained

This document complements, but doesn't replace, the main Installation guide. While geared towards new Node installations, it is a designated guide specifically for migrating existing private keys (p12 files). We opted for a single document to avoid redundancy and potential conflicts. The Node Operator is responsible for navigating this comprehensive guide.
