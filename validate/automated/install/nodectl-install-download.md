## Explained 

Following the command above will execute 3 commands synchronously (in order).

1. It will attempt to disable the `auto_restart` feature of nodectl and fail.  This is excepted behavior because we have not turned our VPS into a Node yet.  The combination of commands executed is intended for both new installations and upgrades, where the auto_restart feature may be engaged. The auto_restart feature cannot be running during an upgrade.
1. It will utilize the `wget` utility; that comes preinstalled on most Debian based distributions, to download the nodectl binary from GitHub and place it in the correct location on your VPS for properly future use.
1. It will then execute the `version` command.
1. Prior to displaying the version for our review, since this is the first run of the nodectl utility, nodectl will automagically setup the logging mechanism.  These log files can be useful when troubleshooting nodectl related issues, later on during normal operation.
1. Finally, nodectl displays the version of nodectl, which will help us determine if the utility properly downloaded; as well as, at the desired version.

The username we are logged in with is also shown in **bold** (in the example above ðŸ‘† only - it will not be colored or highlighted on your real VPS output) to help us interpret the output correctly.
