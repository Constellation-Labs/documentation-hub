## Introduction

The following documentation will help guide a new Node Operator through all the necessary steps required to turn an instance, VPS, or bare metal system into a Validator Node.


#### Normal Install

If you have reached this page in an effort to perform a normal installation, you are in the right place and continue to the next section. ðŸ‘‰

#### Quick Installation

As this walk-through encompasses the `--normal` process of nodectl, you can opt to install via the `--quick-install` mode by using the [Quick Install Walk Through](/validate/automated/quickInstall/nodectlQInstallIntro).

#### Manual Installation

This new installation can be preformed [manually](/validate/manual/manual-install-getting-started) if desired by advanced end users; however, **nodectl is recommended.**
