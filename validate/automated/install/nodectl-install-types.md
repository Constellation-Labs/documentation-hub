## Introduction

The following documentation will help guide a new Node Operator understand the differences between turning a newly created VPS into a Constellation Network Validator Node with the use of `nodectl`.

There are three options:
1. [normal](#normal-install) (nodectl)
1. [quick-install](#quick-installation) (nodectl)
1. [manual](#manual-installation) (without nodectl)

#### Normal Install

A normal installation is a more detailed and interactive method of installing `nodectl` on your VPS.  The process will guide you through each step of the installation interactively with details on each step, along the way.

To begin a normal installation click [here](/validate/automated/install/nodectl-install-install).

#### Quick Installation

As this walk-through encompasses the `--normal` process of nodectl, you can opt to install via the `--quick-install` mode by using the [Quick Install Walk Through](/validate/automated/quickInstall/nodectl-qi-install-start).

#### Manual Installation

This new installation can be preformed [manually](/validate/manual/manual-install-getting-started) if desired by advanced end users; however, **nodectl is recommended.**
