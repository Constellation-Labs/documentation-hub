## Requirements

It is assumed that prior to reaching this documentation, as a future Node Operator, you have followed all the necessary steps in creating a Debian-based Linux server instance, [VPS](/validate/setup-guides/), or bare metal system.

Please refer to [Node Concepts](/validate/) to follow the `step-by-step` guide on building your future Node.

*For Ease of explanation, this documentation will assume use of the **Ubuntu** Debian distribution of Linux on a **VPS** in the cloud.*
