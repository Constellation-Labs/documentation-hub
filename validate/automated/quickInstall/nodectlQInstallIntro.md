## Introduction

The following documentation will help guide a new Node Operator through all the necessary steps required to turn an instance, VPS, or bare metal system into a Validator Node.

#### Quick Install

If you have reached this page in an effort to perform a quick installation, you are in the right place and continue to the next section. ðŸ‘‰

#### Normal Installation

As this walk-through encompasses the `--quick-install` process of nodectl, you can opt to install via the `--normal` mode by using the [New Install Walk Through](/validate/automated/install/nodectlInstallIntro).

#### Manual Installation

This new installation can be preformed [manually](/validate/manual/manual-install-getting-started) if desired by advanced end users; however, **nodectl is recommended.**
