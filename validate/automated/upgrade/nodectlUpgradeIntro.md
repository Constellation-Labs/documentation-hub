## Introduction

This document will walk you through step-by-step instructions upgrading your Node to the latest version of Tessellation and/or nodectl.

Tessellation is the code name for the protocol that runs on your Node.  It is the guts of how your Node is able to operate on the Hypergraph or metagraph.  

**[nodectl](/validate/automated/nodectl)** (code name: Princess Warrier) is a utility that runs on your Node and helps you automate some of the more complex processes that Tessellation requires to run efficiently.
