The following are several suggestions on how to begin creating your Validator Node on top of your new server installation.

## Automation 

### nodectl utility

Once you've determined the location for building your Node or chosen the hardware you'll be using, you can swiftly transform your server into a Node within minutes using Constellation Network's utility, **nodectl**.

## Manual Installation
Build your Node manually by handling all then necessary setup requirements step by step.  

Manual installation will require more time; however, will give a new Node Operator the insight into what is going on "under the hood" on a server that is running as a Constellation Network Node.
