## How to create SSH keys on a Mac

### 1. Open terminal

Open Finder, then at the top status bar, navigate to **Go ‚Üí Utilities ‚Üí Terminal**. You can also find it by searching for ‚Äúterminal‚Äù in the **Search Spotlight**.

Your terminal window will drop you into your¬†home¬†directory for the logged in user, and your command prompt will look something like this: `name@mymac ~ %`. This is where you will begin to type commands to tell the terminal what to do.

### 2. Generate SSH keys

Type the following command into your terminal (`-b 4096` just means byte size).

```
ssh-keygen -b 4096
```

### 3. Select location for keys

You will then be prompted to select a location for the keys. By default, the keys are stored in the `~/.ssh` directory with the filenames `id_rsa` for the private key and `id_rsa.pub` for the public key. If you'd prefer to change the location and/or filenames, skip ahead to **Step 3a**.

Leave this empty to create the key in the default location and press ENTER:

<MacWindow>
Generating public/private rsa key pair.<br />
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/constellation/.ssh/id_rsa): ‚ñâ
</MacWindow>

### 3a. Custom filenames (optional)

Below, you can see that `cn_node_id` was entered as the name of the key pair. The naming convention is as follows: `cn` for Constellation Network, `node` for your node, and `id` for identification file used. You can choose any name to your liking, however, it's recommended that you use a descriptive name to help identify what the key pair is used for.

<MacWindow>
Generating public/private rsa key pair.<br />
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/constellation/.ssh/id_rsa): <span class="token tag attr-name">/Users/constellation/.ssh/cn_node_id</span> ‚ñâ
</MacWindow>

### 4. Create passphrase

Enter a complex password here. This is the password required to use the private key.

<MacWindow>
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): ‚ñâ
</MacWindow>

Following that final prompt, your system will generate the SSH key pair:

<MacWindow>
Your identification has been saved in <span class="token tag attr-name">cn_node_id</span><br />
Your public key has been saved in <span class="token tag attr-name">cn_node_id.pub</span><br />
The key fingerprint is:<br />
SHA256:pbMi8Rm73pgQWUxzVag6VDBqi/sI9sVjVdKtkBmuCVw name@mymac<br />
The key's randomart image is:<br />
+---[RSA 3072]----+<br />
| E=o...o.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br />
|       . .+.+* o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br />
|     oo oB +..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br />
|    o.++ =o.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br />
| . =+.oS.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br />
| ..+++ o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br />
|... o==..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br />
|...ooo.*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br />
| ....= .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br />
+----[SHA256]-----+
</MacWindow>

You now have a public and private key that you can use to authenticate.

| File Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **cn_node_id** | This is the `private` key. |
**cn_node_id.pub** | This is the `public` key. |
