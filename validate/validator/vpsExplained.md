### What is a VPS?

A virtual private server (VPS) is a virtual server that runs on a real server in the cloud that the owner of the VPS does not need to manage or understand.  It hosts all the software required to run our Constellation Network Node. It is called virtual because it only consumes a portion of the server's actual physical resources.
