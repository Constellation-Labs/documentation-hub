### What is a tarball?

A tarball file, often with a `.tar`, `.tar.gz`, or `.tgz` extension, is a type of compressed archive used primarily on Unix-based systems like Linux and macOS. The term “tarball” refers to files created by the tar (Tape Archive) command, which packages multiple files and directories into a single archive file, making it easier to distribute, back up, or transfer.
