## Before you begin:
A Validator Node Operator must have been previously accepted to join the network; and therefore, already be part of the [seed list](/validate/index#seed-list).

## Create a Deployment Plan

### Hosting

Decide on how you will run your validator.

- Cloud provider
- Hosting provider
- Dedicated server

### Management

Decide if you want to automate the creation of your Node or handle it manually.

- nodectl
- manual installation
